In this book, Didier Sornette boldly applies his varied experience in these areas to propose a simple, powerful, and general theory of how, why, and when stock markets crash. Most attempts to explain market failures seek to pinpoint triggering mechanisms that occur hours, days, or weeks before the collapse. Sornette proposes a radically different view: the underlying cause can be sought months and even years before the abrupt, catastrophic event in the build-up of cooperative speculation, which often translates into an accelerating rise of the market price, otherwise known as a """"bubble."""" Anchoring his sophisticated, step-by-step analysis in leading-edge physical and statistical modeling techniques, he unearths remarkable insights and some predictions--among them, that the """"end of the growth era"""" will occur around 2050. Sornette probes major historical precedents, from the decades-long """"tulip mania"""" in the Netherlands that wilted suddenly in 1637 to the South Sea Bubble that ended with the first huge market crash in England in 1720, to the Great Crash of October 1929 and Black Monday in 1987, to cite just a few. He concludes that most explanations other than cooperative self-organization fail to account for the subtle bubbles by which the markets lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Any investor or investment professional who seeks a genuine understanding of looming financial disasters should read this book. Physicists, geologists, biologists, economists, and others will welcome Why Stock Markets Crash as a highly original """"scientific tale,"""" as Sornette aptly puts it, of the exciting and sometimes fearsome--but no longer quite so unfathomable--world of stock markets.""","Economic bubbles Financial crises Stock market crashes Systemic risk Behavioral finance Financial crisis Didier Sornette Stock market Wall Street Crash Efficient-market hypothesis Financial market Market","Finance","Corporate finance"

But today, most corporations are obsessed with maximizing their stock prices, resulting in short-term thinking and the kind of cook-the-books corruption seen in the Enron and WorldCom scandals. How did this happen? In this groundbreaking book, Lawrence E. Mitchell traces the origins of the problem to the first decade of the 20th century, when industrialists and bankers began merging existing companies into huge “combines”—today’s giant corporations—so they could profit by manufacturing and selling stock in these new entities. He describes and analyzes the legal changes that made this possible, the federal regulatory efforts that missed the significance of this transforming development, and the changes in American society and culture that led more and more Americans to enter the market, turning from relatively safe bonds to riskier common stock in the hopes of becoming rich. Financiers and the corporations they controlled encouraged this trend, but as stock ownership expanded and businesses were increasingly forced to cater to stockholders’ “get rich quick” expectations, a subtle but revolutionary shift in the nature of the American economy occurred: finance no longer served industry; instead, industry began to serve finance. The Speculation Economy analyzes the history behind the opening of this economic Pandora’s box, the root cause of so many modern acts of corporate malfeasance.","Accounting scandals Corporate crime Stock market Corporate law Enron MCI Inc.

The result of their effort is an original investment methodology called CROCI (Cash Return on Capital Invested), best described as a variation of the economic profit model.  For over a decade now, Costantinis group at Deutsche Bank has been using this valuation tool every time it has had to take a view on the pricing of an equity asset, be it a market, a sector or an individual sharein other words, every single working day, since it is this groups job to advise institutional investors on equity valuation. Costantini describes in detail, accompanied by concrete examples in the form of charts and graphs, the precise investment results of the actual implementation of the CROCI approach in the global equity markets since 1996. Readers will enjoy taking this journey with Costantini to see how and why the model was developed, assess the results of ten years of actual implementation and measure the successes of using this model in stock picking and portfolio construction. This book will also make it easy for them to see how the CROCI approach can be used successfully by others now and in the future.  The book is divided into four parts. The first part is a review and discussion of the fundamentals of investment analysis. The second part is dedicated to the construction of economic data, with the sole objective of calculating an economically meaningful asset multiple and relative return, the combination of which gives an economic PE ratio, the authors main stock selection tool. While the economic profit model is not exactly new, it is still largely ignored by the investment community. In essence, it does three things: it calculates the real amount of cash, or value created by a business; it compares the market value of an asset to an approximation of its replacement value; and it assumes that the former will converge to the latter through the arbitrage of investors and capital providers. The third part is dedicated to the analysis of economic data, and the last part deals with the actual implementation of the CROCI economic profit model, including real life examples. This final part also discusses how to use the output of the CROCI model with individual stocks, and then with investment portfolios. *Techniques are based on the authors performance record at Deutsche Bank since 1996 *Based on almost ten years of proprietary knowledge and implementation of these techniques *Factual illustrations of the results of the valuation techniques are provided at each step","Valuation Fundamental analysis Stock market Corporate finance CROCI Stock selection criterion Discounted cash flow Investment Finance Stock valuation Investment management Chepakovich valuation model","Finance","Corporate finance"

Employing a carefully engineered financing mix, it has long been used to fund large-scale natural resource projects, from pipelines and refineries to electric-generating facilities and hydroelectric projects. Increasingly, project financing is emerging as the preferred alternative to conventional methods of financing infrastructure and other large-scale projects worldwide.  The intricacies of project financing are formidable, and can easily be misunderstood and, consequently, misused. While project financing structures share certain common features, by necessity, they require tailoring the package to the particular circumstances of the project. That is where both the benefits and the challenges lie.  As an investment banker currently with Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, John D. Finnerty has a wealth of experience in project financing. Now, he brings his considerable expertise to a comprehensive exploration of the facts, figures--and potential faux pas--surrounding Project Financing.  What distinguishes project financing from conventional direct financing is that rather than looking to the firm's entire asset portfolio to generate cash flow, in project financing, the project is """"a distinct legal entity"""" and the financing is tailored to the cash flow characteristics of the project assets. Such a structure can yield a more efficient allocation of risks and returns than conventional financing, but careful financial engineering is critical.  With actual examples and case studies, Project Financing takes you through the process step by step. It covers the rationale for project financing, how to prepare the financial plan, assess the risks, design the financing mix, and raise the funds. Along with cogent analyses of why some project financing plans have succeeded while others have failed, you'll find detailed information on:   Designing contractual arrangements to support project financing Issues for the host government--legislative provisions, public/private infrastructure partnerships, public/private financing structures  Credit requirements of lenders, and how to determine the project's borrowing capacity  How to prepare cash flow projections and use them to measure expected rates of return  Tax and accounting considerations  Detailed case studies--including Euro Disneyland and the Eurotunnel Project--that illustrate how to apply the analytical techniques described in the book   From funding sources and contract options to security arrangements and legal requirements, Project Financing provides the most complete coverage available today.""","Corporate finance Project finance Public–private partnership Cash flow Finance Public administration","Finance","Corporate finance"

Applied Corporate Finance provides a user’s perspective to corporate finance, by posing the three major questions that every business has to answer, and then providing the tools and the analytical techniques needed to answer them. The three questions are-   Where do we invest our resources? (The Investment Decision) The first part of the book looks at how to assess risk and develop a risk profile for a firm, convert this risk profile into a hurdle rate, and develops the basic rules that need to be followed in estimating the returns on any investment.  How should we fund these investments? (The Financing Decision) Firms generally can use debt, equity or some combination of the two to fund projects. This part of the book examines the relationship between this choice and the hurdle rate to be used in analyzing projects, and presents ways in which the financing decision can be used to maximize firm value. It also sets up a framework for picking the right kind of security for any firm.  How much cash can and should we return to the owners? (The Dividend Decision) The third part of the book establishes a process that can be used to decide how much cash should be taken out of the business, and in what form — dividends or stock buybacks. The final chapter in the book ties in the value of the firm to these three decisions, and provides insight into how firms can enhance value.   In summary, this is a book about coming up with real solutions to real problems, using real-time data on real companies.","Corporate finance Dividend policy Finance Dividend Capital structure Stock valuation Discounted cash flow Investment Stock Equity Cost of capital Sum of perpetuities method","Finance","Corporate finance"

Such reliance is badly misplaced. In Corporate Governance, Jonathan Macey argues that less government regulation--not more--is what's needed to ensure that managers of public companies keep their promises to investors.  Macey tells how heightened government oversight has put a stranglehold on what is the best protection against malfeasance by self-serving management: the market itself. Corporate governance, he shows, is about keeping promises to shareholders; failure to do so results in diminished investor confidence, which leads to capital flight and other dire economic consequences. Macey explains the relationship between corporate governance and the various market and nonmarket institutions and mechanisms used to control public corporations; he discusses how nonmarket corporate governance devices such as boards and whistle-blowers are highly susceptible to being co-opted by management and are generally guided more by self-interest and personal greed than by investor interests. In contrast, market-driven mechanisms such as trading and takeovers represent more reliable solutions to the problem of corporate governance. Inefficient regulations are increasingly hampering these important and truly effective corporate controls. Macey examines a variety of possible means of corporate governance, including shareholder voting, hedge funds, and private equity funds.  Corporate Governance reveals why the market is the best guardian of shareholder interests.","Stock market Corporate governance Governance Hedge fund Sarbanes–Oxley Act Insider trading Stock exchange Enron Stock United Kingdom company law United States corporate law","Finance","Corporate finance"

The author helps a broad spectrum of professionals understand the salient points and real world implications of a 'value management' movement which has taken hold in many corporations in the United States and around the world. This movement is being supported by some of the major institutional investors who influence financial markets.  The main goal of Shareholder Value is to help working professionals grasp the concept of value 'creators' and 'destroyers', along with the implications. He also provides tools to measure the success (or failure) of major strategic and operational initiatives and enables corporate managers to understand how shareholder value is created, and then directs behaviour toward 'value-based' planning and action.  Although mainly aimed at the professional market, Shareholder Value will also be of use to students of business and finance as it is intended to provide a comprehensive foundation for important elements of business strategy and acquisition valuation, corporate financial analysis, capital investments, corporate financing and economic value based metrics.","Corporate finance Financial economics Shareholder value Valuation Mergers and acquisitions Finance Value Financial capital Fundamental analysis Draft:Stern Value Management Business value","Finance","Corporate finance"

The book is written for courses in banking and finance at Masters/MBA level, or undergraduate degrees specialising in this area. Bank practitioners wishing to deepen and broaden their understanding of banking issues may also be attracted to this book. While they often have exceptional and detailed knowledge of the areas they have worked in, busy bankers may be all too unaware of the key broader issues. Consider the fundamental questions: What is unique about a bank? and What differentiates it from other financial institutions? Answering these questions begins to show how banks should evolve and adapt - or fail. If bankers know the underlying reasons for why profitable banks exist, it will help them to devise strategies for sustained growth.  Modern Banking concludes with a set of case studies that give practical insight into the key issues covered in the book:   The core banking functions  Different types of banks and diversification of bank activities  Risk management: issues and techniques  Global regulation: Basel 1 and Basel 2.

Today America relies more than ever on immigrant brainpower: more than half the Ph.D.s working here are foreign born, as are nearly half the physicists, computer scientists, and mathematicians, and many of Silicon Valley's high-tech leaders. But, David Heenan warns, they may not be here long. In Flight Capital, Heenan describes how, within the past decade, America has gone from being the top importer of brainpower to a net exporter. Empowered by the globalization of technology, emerging economies from Iceland to India are using aggressive initiatives to attract top knowledge workers. In a """"reverse brain drain,"""" hundreds of thousands of the best and brightest in America are returning to their native lands to pursue new opportunities. Heenan recounts the stories of dozens of emigrating professionals as an engaging way to explore the various factors—personal, cultural, economic, and political—that are fueling the exodus. Flight Capital is the first comprehensive study of the global battle for human capital and its consequences for America, at a time when a shortage of talented labor is exacerbated by post-9/11 immigration restrictions. The outflow of brainpower, Heenan argues, threatens U.S. technological and economic preeminence, and even our security, unless quick action is taken. He proposes a dozen hard-hitting measures to correct the situation, both short and long term.

It's being used more and more frequently—and more successfully—on a wide variety of high-profile corporate projects, and has long been used to fund large-scale natural resource projects, from pipelines and refineries to electric-generating facilities and hydroelectric projects. But the challenges of successful project financing are immense, and the requirements of the process can easily be misunderstood. This newly updated edition of Project Financing takes you through the process step by step. Using actual examples and case studies—including Euro Disneyland and the Eurotunnel Project—that illustrate how to apply the analytical techniques described in the book, it covers the rationale for project financing, how to prepare the financial plan, assess the risks, design the financing mix, and raise the funds. John Finnerty draws on his vast experience in the field to detail each step of the process, describing the circumstances in which it is most likely to be advantageous, how to craft contractual arrangements to allocate risks and rewards among the interested parties, and how to deal with government, legal, tax, and financial issues. Finnerty has fully revised his original classic work to include up-to-date material on the rationale for project financing, assessing risk, security arrangements, legal structure and contract options, preparing the financial plan, estimating the borrowing capacity of a project, legal requirements, and much more. In addition, he has added completely new chapters that cover the role of financial institutions that finance large projects, analytical tools that are increasingly useful in capital budgeting, and techniques for hedging project risks. His latest research draws from the work of renowned Harvard researcher Benjamin C. Esty and illustrates in detail why some project financing plans have succeeded while others have failed. For corporate finance professionals, CFO's, financial analysts, project planners, and private investors, Project Financing, Second Edition demystifies the complexities of project financing and provides an invaluable guide for anyone who wants to master innovation in corporate finance today.","Corporate finance Project finance Finance Public–private partnership Capital structure Financial modeling Build–operate–transfer","Finance","Corporate finance"

Demands on the boards of directors of public companies throughout the nation are more acute than ever, and scrutiny is at new highs. There is a critical need for new insights and fresh approaches as corporate America addresses a real crisis in governance.  	Effective solutions are unlikely to come from increased government regulation, which is all too easily honored to the letter of the law while being effectively sidestepped in spirit. For example, companies like Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco, at the time of their catastrophic falls, would have received good grades for compliance with myriad guidelines subsequently passed to prevent similar debacles.  	Authors Newquist and Russell show clearly that the solutions need to come from within boards, by adherence to key cornerstones of good governance like duty of care, duty of loyalty, and a proactive intent to protect shareholders. Stressing a principles-based approach, the book outlines concrete procedures that enable accountability, transparency, performance measurement, and strong checks and balances. This insightful, highly readable book is a call to action and provides a plan to meet a modern board's challenges.","Corporate law Accounting scandals Management Corporate crime Corporate governance MCI Inc.

Stephen Ross developed the no arbitrage principle, tying asset pricing to the simple proposition that there are no free lunches in financial markets, and jointly with John Cox he developed the related concept of risk-neutral pricing. In this book Ross makes a strong case that these concepts are the fundamental pillars of modern finance and, in particular, of market efficiency. In an efficient market prices reflect the information possessed by the market and, as a consequence, trading schemes using commonly available information to beat the market are doomed to fail. By stark contrast, the currently popular stance offered by behavioral finance, fueled by a number of apparent anomalies in the financial markets, regards market prices as subject to the psychological whims of investors. But without any appeal to psychology, Ross shows that neoclassical theory provides a simple and rich explanation that resolves many of the anomalies on which behavioral finance has been fixated. Based on the inaugural Princeton Lectures in Finance, sponsored by the Bendheim Center for Finance of Princeton University, this elegant book represents a major contribution to the ongoing debate on market efficiency, and serves as a useful primer on the fundamentals of finance for both scholars and practitioners.","Financial economics Financial markets Behavioral finance Mathematical finance Stephen Ross Efficient-market hypothesis Finance Kernel Behavioral economics Arbitrage Corporate finance","Finance","Corporate finance"

These are difficult and complex problems, but our government's strategy for dealing with them has been essentially not to deal with them at all. Over and over, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, we're told that we're on our own--""""Here's a tax cut and a private account; now go fend for yourself.""""  	As Jared Bernstein points out, this approach doesn't make any sense as a strategy for solving the enormous systemic problems we face. It's just a way of shifting economic risk from those most able to bear it--the government and the nation's corporations--to those least able: individuals and families. The result has been greater wealth for the top 1 percent of Americans and stagnant living standards and increasing insecurity for the vast majority.  	In All Together Now, Bernstein outlines a new strategy, one that applauds individual initiative but recognizes that the problems we face as a nation can be solved only if we take a more collaborative approach. The message is simple: we're all in this together.  	Bernstein draws on recent and historic events to explore how the proponents of what he dubs the YOYO (you're-on-your-own) approach have sold the idea, exposing the fallacies and ulterior motives in their arguments as well as the disasterous consequences of their policies. More importantly, he details practical WITT (we're-in-this-together) initiatives in specific areas like globalization, health care, and employment that could improve the lives of millions of Americans without increasing overall national spending. And he offers advice on how to overcome objections to the WITT agenda and bring the country together so that both risks and benefits are shared more fairly.  	While the prevailing philosophy insists that all we can do is cope with massive social forces, each of us on our own, Bernstein argues that we can unite and shape these forces to meet our needs. The optimistic message of All Together Now is that the economic challenges we face are not insoluble; we can wield the tools of government to meet them in such a way as to build a more just and equitable society.""","International business Offshore finance Offshoring Outsourcing Risk All Together Now","Finance","Corporate finance"

There have been quite a few accounting scandals in Asia in the recent years – now rivaling those we have seen in the Americas and Europe. Assessing potential or active overseas investments requires reliance on financial statements, the full parameters of which may vary from region to region. To effectively analyze statements, it is necessary to first understand the framework underlying these financial statements and then lay out a protocol for detecting irregularities. It's impossible to create and implement a practical plan without a deeper knowledge of the various factors at play.  Asian Statement Analysis: Detecting Financial Irregularities provides a framework for analysis that makes irregularities stand out. Authors Chin Hwee Tan and Thomas R. Robinson discuss international financial reporting standards, including characteristics particular to the Asian region. Tan and Robinson's combined background in academia and Asian finance give them a multi-modal perspective and position them as top authorities on the topic. In the book, they address issues such as:   		Detection of irregularities independent of particular accounting rules  		The most common irregularities in the Asian market  		Similarities and differences between U.S. and Asian accounting techniques  		An overarching framework for irregularity detection   	The book uses real-world examples to illustrate the concepts presented, with the focus on Asian companies.

Inspired by Michel Foucault’s framework of critical discourse analysis in The History of Sexuality, the argument dissects the rules of formation that govern the evolving discourse on risk. The author argues that the mathematically formal technology of risk emerges from within specific institutions and economic formations; thereby limiting its utility in the regulation of global financial markets. Exploring how the applied technology of risk has been implicated for fueling a major financial crisis, his work also demonstrates how the regulation of global financial markets and abstruse financial instruments in advanced industrialized countries impacts the lives of the poorest people in developing countries and emerging markets.","Systemic risk World economy Economic bubbles Economic systems Financial crises Global financial system Financial crisis of 2007–08 Market Financial crisis Risk Emerging markets","Finance","Corporate finance"

Gone are the days when CEOs set agendas and earned 500 times more than average employees. Now, transparency rules. Corporations must establish new systems of accountability, and encourage long-term participation in decision-making by both shareholders and staff. Those that succeed will be better equipped to create wealth, solve complex problems, and compete in global markets.  The role of the directorate and the need to ensure an effective framework for its accountability to owners is paramount to success. In line with this thinking, Mastering Global Corporate Governance argues that one of the key responsibilities of the Board is leadership, and that the root of good corporate governance lies in the strength of a corporate leader. In particular, it focuses on two 'burning issues' for senior executives: how can the boards of global companies best lead their companies through the fundamental dilemmas that face all boards?; and how can Boards, entrusted with ultimate responsibility for the way a company exercises leadership, provide that leadership?","Corporate law Management Corporate governance Accountability Governance Political engineering Board of directors Institute of Corporate Directors","Finance","Corporate finance"

In 1993, the first volume provided the standard reference to this new approach in finance--an approach that, as editor Richard Thaler put it, """"entertains the possibility that some of the agents in the economy behave less than fully rationally some of the time."""" Much has changed since then. Not least, the bursting of the Internet bubble and the subsequent market decline further demonstrated that financial markets often fail to behave as they would if trading were truly dominated by the fully rational investors who populate financial theories. Behavioral finance has made an indelible mark on areas from asset pricing to individual investor behavior to corporate finance, and continues to see exciting empirical and theoretical advances. Advances in Behavioral Finance, Volume II constitutes the essential new resource in the field. It presents twenty recent papers by leading specialists that illustrate the abiding power of behavioral finance--of how specific departures from fully rational decision making by individual market agents can provide explanations of otherwise puzzling market phenomena. As with the first volume, it reaches beyond the world of finance to suggest, powerfully, the importance of pursuing behavioral approaches to other areas of economic life.""","Behavioral finance Financial markets Financial economics Stock market Market trends Behavioral economics Finance Arbitrage Market sentiment Economic bubble Stock Momentum","Finance","Corporate finance"

But in The Next Great Globalization, eminent economist Frederic Mishkin argues the opposite: that financial globalization today is essential for poor nations to become rich. Mishkin argues that an effectively managed financial globalization promises benefits on the scale of the hugely successful trade and information globalizations of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This financial revolution can lift developing nations out of squalor and increase the wealth and stability of emerging and industrialized nations alike. By presenting an unprecedented picture of the potential benefits of financial globalization, and by showing in clear and hard-headed terms how these gains can be realized, Mishkin provides a hopeful vision of the next phase of globalization.  Mishkin draws on historical examples to caution that mismanagement of financial globalization, often aided and abetted by rich elites, can wreak havoc in developing countries, but he uses these examples to demonstrate how better policies can help poor nations to open up their economies to the benefits of global investment. According to Mishkin, the international community must provide incentives for developing countries to establish effective property rights, banking regulations, accounting practices, and corporate governance--the institutions necessary to attract and manage global investment. And the West must be a partner in integrating the financial systems of rich and poor countries--to the benefit of both.  The Next Great Globalization makes the case that finance will be a driving force in the twenty-first-century economy, and demonstrates how this force can and should be shaped to the benefit of all, especially the disadvantaged nations most in need of growth and prosperity.","International trade Anti-globalization Cultural geography Economic geography Capitalism Globalization Global financial system International Monetary Fund Financial crisis Anti-globalization movement Economic globalization","Finance","Corporate finance"

The most recent wave, the 5th takeover wave of the 1990s, was characterized by an unprecedented number of corporate restructurings in terms of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), public-to-private transactions, spin-offs and divestitures, and leveraged recapitalizations. Following the collapse of the stock market in March 2000, M&A activity slumped dramatically, but this pause ended in the second half of 2004 when takeover deals occurred again quite frequently. Indeed, some observers wonder whether the 6th takeover wave has started. The takeover wave in the 1990s was particularly remarkable in terms of size and geographical dispersion. For the first time, Continental European firms were as eager to participate as their US and UK counterparts, and M&A activity in Europe hit levels similar to those experienced in the US. Due to its financial impact and the unprecedented activity in Continental Europe, the 5th takeover wave of the 1990s and recent takeover activity (in biotech, utilities, pharmaceuticals) have triggered a great deal of interesting academic research. This volume brings together a selection of insightful papers. An impressive group of international authors address the following themes: takeover regulation; the cyclical pattern of the M&A markets and probable causes and effects; methods to determine the performance of success of M&A actions; cross border deals; means of payment and its effects; studies of hostile bids; high leverage takeovers and delistings.","Mergers and acquisitions Corporate finance Reverse takeover Takeover Listing","Finance","Corporate finance"

Every family, looking at the next generation, hopes to confer advantages that are more than just material and financial--to inculcate character and leadership, to inspire creativity and enterprise, to help all family members find and follow their individual callings, and to avoid the financial dependency and loss of initiative that can all too often be an unwanted consequence of financial success. Yet many families never succeed in realizing that vision, much less sustaining it for three, four, or five generations and beyond.  	James Hughes has thought deeply about these challenges, and his insights are at once practical and profound. For more than three decades, he has personally guided multiple generations of families in creating strategies to preserve their human and intellectual capital as well as their financial assets. His teachings synthesize insights from psychology, anthropology, political history, philosophy, economic theory, and the law, with examples ranging from Aristotle to cutting-edge social science theory. His ideas have been taken up by numerous exceptional families, by their advisers, and by scores of authors, practitioners, and academics who have found value in the methods he pioneered.  	The first edition of this book, privately published, became a word-of-mouth classic. Now, Hughes has updated and substantially expanded it with new chapters that challenge conventional notions of wealth and offer guidelines for conserving family assets in the broadest senses. Filled with tested principles and practices for family governance and joint decision making, it is a rich source of workable wisdom that family members can put into practice today, to the enduring benefit and gratitude of future generations.","Inheritance Wealth Trust law Financial services Tax avoidance","Finance","Corporate finance"

Rather than immediately addressing the minutiae of supervision, Guillaume Plantin and Jean-Charles Rochet first identify a fundamental economic rationale for supervising the solvency of insurance companies: policyholders are the """"bankers"""" of insurance companies.

That model is provided by the business cycle.  Economics for Financial Markets' takes the reader from the basics of financial market valuation to a more sophisticated understanding of the actions that traders take which ultimately drives the volatility in the financial markets.

To this end, the book provides students with a three-tiered learning experience. The first tier provides students with a broad appreciation of the commercial evolution of sport, and how it has managed to move from the kitchen-table model to the corporate-boardroom model, and along the way become quite a sophisticated industry from a financial viewpoint. Attention will be given to the commercial development of sport using USA and European pro-sport leagues as a benchmark. Changes in the funding arrangement of sport will be highlighted, and the different funding sources will be examined in detail. The second tier will give students a sound grounding in the principles and practice of effective financial management. Students will be introduced to basic accounting principles and practice, and then led into more complex issues of pricing, costing, financial analysis, budgeting, and financial projections. The third tier will explore future developments in sport finance and funding, and examine how they will impact on sport management knowledge and skill requirements. Within this framework, the book will provide students with two types of learning outcomes. The first outcome is knowledge based and will include the following: * a grounded understanding of the commercial evolution of sport from 1950-the present * an understanding of the different commercial phases sport goes through to reach commercial maturity * an appreciation of the major global sport events and leagues, and their financial arrangements. * an insight into the financial strengths and weaknesses of contemporary sport.The second outcome is skill-based, and by reading the book and completing the cases students will be able to: * identify the different legal structures of sport organisations and the financial implications of each structure * explain the main accounting conventions and how they impact on the financial management of sport organisations * identify the foundations of double entry bookkeeping * construct a simple set of accounts for a sport organisation * use financial ratio analysis to evaluate the financial performance of sport organisations * understand different methods of constructing budgets, and use them to control the financial operation of a sport organisation * set up models for identifying and managing costs * identify different methods for setting prices for sport goods and services, and to apply them to specific settings and events. * undertake a financial planning exercise and/or feasibility study for a sport organisation or facility * undertake a cost-benefit analysis for a sport organisation event.","Management accounting Finance Financial literacy Corporate finance Feasibility study Accounting Financial statement Roger W.

Exploring the cultural nuances that inform the Hispanic experience, HR and the New Hispanic Workforce details what it takes to incorporate the values and sensibilities Hispanic employees bring to the workplace that are so often at odds with those of traditional corporate America. Combining their original research with best-practices examples—from Citigroup Foundation’s internship program to Procter & Gamble’s success creating a Hispanic-friendly workplace—the authors lay out a road map for attracting the best Hispanic candidates, effectively evaluating their performance, and cultivating and retaining their talents. Numerous checklists, questionnaires, sample interview questions, HR guidelines (some in both English and Spanish), and detailed summaries of key lessons at the end of each chapter offer powerful tools for finding new ways to address the increasing use of Spanish in the workplace and effectively reaching into Hispanic communities to uncover and recruit talent.","Workplace","Finance","Corporate finance"

Whereas once the subject addressed mainly the financing of corporations--equity, debt, and valuation--today it also embraces crucial issues of governance, liquidity, risk management, relationships between banks and corporations, and the macroeconomic impact of corporations. However, this progress has left in its wake a jumbled array of concepts and models that students are often hard put to make sense of. Here, one of the world's leading economists offers a lucid, unified, and comprehensive introduction to modern corporate finance theory. Jean Tirole builds his landmark book around a single model, using an incentive or contract theory approach. Filling a major gap in the field, The Theory of Corporate Finance is an indispensable resource for graduate and advanced undergraduate students as well as researchers of corporate finance, industrial organization, political economy, development, and macroeconomics. Tirole conveys the organizing principles that structure the analysis of today's key management and public policy issues, such as the reform of corporate governance and auditing; the role of private equity, financial markets, and takeovers; the efficient determination of leverage, dividends, liquidity, and risk management; and the design of managerial incentive packages. He weaves empirical studies into the book's theoretical analysis. And he places the corporation in its broader environment, both microeconomic and macroeconomic, and examines the two-way interaction between the corporate environment and institutions. Setting a new milestone in the field, The Theory of Corporate Finance will be the authoritative text for years to come.","Financial markets Credit United States housing bubble Systemic risk Financial crises Liquidity risk Finance Corporate finance Market liquidity Credit crunch Corporate governance Private equity","Finance","Corporate finance"

Though both focus on the same broad problem, investment decision-making, the gap between the two sides--and between theory and practice--remains embarrassingly large. This book synthesizes cutting-edge developments in corporate finance and related fields--in particular, real options and game theory--to help bridge this gap. In clear, straightforward exposition and through numerous examples and applications from various industries, Han Smit and Lenos Trigeorgis set forth an extended valuation framework for competitive strategies. The book follows a problem-solving approach that synthesizes ideas from game theory, real options, and strategy. Thinking in terms of options-games can help managers address questions such as: When is it best to invest early to preempt competitive entry, and when to wait? Should a firm compete in R&D or adopt an accommodating stance? How does one value growth options or infrastructure investments? The authors provide a wide range of valuation examples, such as acquisition strategies, R&D investment in high-tech sectors, joint research ventures, product introductions in consumer electronics, infrastructure, and oil exploration investment. Representing a major step beyond standard real options or strategy analysis, and extending the power of real options and strategic thinking in a rigorous fashion, Strategic Investment will be an indispensable guide and resource for corporate managers, MBA students, and academics alike.","Management Real options Financial economics Corporate finance Options Real options valuation Strategic management Lenos Trigeorgis Valuation Finance","Finance","Corporate finance"

The book then features the valuation models that can be used to determine the value of banks and insurance companies including the Discounted Cash Flow, Dividend Discount Model, and Residual Income Model (with the appropriate estimation techniques for the cost of capital and cash flow in financial industries). The main techniques to perform the relative valuation of financial institutions are then presented: along the traditional multiples (P/E, P/BV, P/TBV, P/NAV), the multiples based on industry-specific value drivers are discussed (for example, P/Pre Provision Profit, P/Deposits, P/Premiums, P/Number of branches).

Offering a user perspective to corporate finance, this text poses three major questions that every business has to answer, and provides the tools and the analytical techniques needed to answer these questions.  1. Where do we invest our resources? (The Investment Decision)  The first part of the book shows how to assess risk and develop a risk profile for a firm, and convert this risk profile into a hurdle rate. You'll also learn basic rules for estimating the returns on any investment.  2. How should we fund these investments? (The Financing Decision)  Firms generally can use debt, equity, or some combination of the two to fund projects. This part of the book examines the relationship between this choice and the hurdle rate for analyzing projects, and shows how to use the financing decision to maximize firm value. You'll also find a framework for picking the right kind of security for any firm.  3. How much cash can and should we return to the owners? (The Dividend Decision)  The third part of the book establishes a process for deciding how much cash should be taken out of the business and in what form (dividends or stock buybacks).  The final chapter in the book ties the value of the firm to these three decisions, and provides insight into how firms can enhance value.","Corporate finance Dividend policy Capital structure Finance Discounted cash flow Fundamental analysis Valuation Adjusted present value Investment Bond Stock Cost of capital","Finance","Corporate finance"

The terms of these contracts depend on the information available to insurance firms. Unlike age and gender, information about individual survival probabilities cannot be readily ascertained. This asymmetric information causes market inefficiencies, such as adverse selection. Groundbreaking in its scope, The Economic Theory of Annuities offers readers a theoretical analysis of the functioning of private annuity markets. Starting with a general analysis of survival functions, stochastic dominance, and characterization of changes in longevity, Eytan Sheshinski derives the demand for annuities using a model of individuals who jointly choose their lifetime consumption and retirement age. The relation between life insurance and annuities that have a bequest option is examined and """"annuity options"""" are proposed as a response to the lack of secondary markets. This book also investigates the macroeconomic policy implications of annuities and changes in longevity on aggregate savings. Sheshinski utilizes statistical population theory to shed light on the debate of whether the surge in savings and growth in Asia and other countries can be attributed to higher longevity of the population and whether this surge is durable. This book shows how understanding annuities becomes essential as governments that grapple with insolvency of public social security systems place greater emphasis on individual savings accounts.""","Actuarial science Investment Insurance Retirement Life annuity Annuity Fixed annuity","Finance","Risk"

This book covers the various roles of the risk management function. Rather than describing every possible role in exhaustive detail, the authors have provided a story line for each of the discussed topics, including practical issues that a risk manager needs to consider when tackling the subject, possible solutions to difficulties that might be encountered, background knowledge that is essential to know, and more intricate practices and techniques that are being used. By providing these fundamentals, the novice risk professional can gain a thorough understanding of the topic in question while the more experienced professional can use some of the more advanced concepts within the book. Thus the book can be used to broaden your own knowledge of the risk world, both by familiarizing yourself with areas in which you lack experience and by enhancing your knowledge in areas that you already have expertise. All authors are leaders in their field who between them have the expertise and knowledge, both practical and theoretical, to produce this definitive risk management guide.

But until now asset-price analysis has largely been inaccessible to everyone except PhDs in financial economics. In this book, Sharpe changes that by setting out his state-of-the-art approach to asset pricing in a nonmathematical form that will be comprehensible to a broad range of investment professionals, including investment advisors, money managers, and financial analysts. Bridging the gap between the best financial theory and investment practice, Investors and Markets will help investment professionals make better portfolio choices by being smarter about asset prices. Based on Sharpe's Princeton Lectures in Finance, Investors and Markets presents a method of analyzing asset prices that accounts for the real behavior of investors. Sharpe makes this technique accessible through a new, one-of-a-kind computer program (available for free on his Web site, at http://www.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/apsim/index.html) that enables users to create virtual markets, setting the starting conditions and then allowing trading until equilibrium is reached and trading stops. Program users can then analyze the final portfolios and asset prices, see expected returns, and measure risk. In addition to popularizing the most sophisticated form of asset-price analysis, Investors and Markets summarizes much of Sharpe's most important previous work and reflects a lifetime of thinking about investing by one of the leading minds in financial economics. Any serious investment professional will benefit from Sharpe's unique insights.","Mathematical finance Investment Financial markets Financial ratios Financial economics Capital asset pricing model Portfolio Sharpe ratio Alpha Beta Passive management Futures contract","Finance","Risk"

Indeed, most of the asset returns exhibit “fat-tails” distributions and investors exhibit asymmetric preferences. These empirical findings lead to the development of a new area of research dedicated to the introduction of higher order moments in portfolio theory and asset pricing models.  Multi-moment asset pricing is a revolutionary new way of modeling time series in finance which allows various degrees of long-term memory to be generated. It allows risk and prices of risk to vary through time enabling the accurate valuation of long-lived assets. This book presents the state-of-the art in multi-moment asset allocation and pricing models and provides many new developments in a single volume, collecting in a unified framework theoretical results and applications previously scattered throughout the financial literature. The topics covered in this comprehensive volume include: four-moment individual risk preferences, mathematics of the multi-moment efficient frontier, coherent asymmetric risks measures, hedge funds asset allocation under higher moments, time-varying specifications of (co)moments and multi-moment asset pricing models with homogeneous and heterogeneous agents.

In the 1950s, who but the most rampant optimist would have dreamt that over the next fifty years the real return on equities would be 9% per year? Yet this is what happened in the U.S. stock market. The optimists triumphed. However, as Don Marquis observed, an optimist is someone who never had much experience. The authors of this book extend our experience across regions and across time. They present a comprehensive and consistent analysis of investment returns for equities, bonds, bills, currencies and inflation, spanning sixteen countries, from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first. This is achieved in a clear and simple way, with over 130 color diagrams that make comparison easy.Crucially, the authors analyze total returns, including reinvested income. They show that some historical indexes overstate long-term performance because they are contaminated by survivorship bias and that long-term stock returns are in most countries seriously overestimated, due to a focus on periods that with hindsight are known to have been successful.The book also provides the first comprehensive evidence on the long-term equity risk premium--the reward for bearing the risk of common stocks. The authors reveal whether the United States and United Kingdom have had unusually high stock market returns compared to other countries. The book covers the U.S., the U.K., Japan, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark, and South Africa.Triumph of the Optimists is required reading for investment professionals, financial economists, and investors.

Samuelson Award for scholarly writing on lifelong financial security, John Cochrane's Asset Pricing now appears in a revised edition that unifies and brings the science of asset pricing up to date for advanced students and professionals. Cochrane traces the pricing of all assets back to a single idea--price equals expected discounted payoff--that captures the macro-economic risks underlying each security's value. By using a single, stochastic discount factor rather than a separate set of tricks for each asset class, Cochrane builds a unified account of modern asset pricing. He presents applications to stocks, bonds, and options. Each model--consumption based, CAPM, multifactor, term structure, and option pricing--is derived as a different specification of the discounted factor. The discount factor framework also leads to a state-space geometry for mean-variance frontiers and asset pricing models. It puts payoffs in different states of nature on the axes rather than mean and variance of return, leading to a new and conveniently linear geometrical representation of asset pricing ideas. Cochrane approaches empirical work with the Generalized Method of Moments, which studies sample average prices and discounted payoffs to determine whether price does equal expected discounted payoff. He translates between the discount factor, GMM, and state-space language and the beta, mean-variance, and regression language common in empirical work and earlier theory. The book also includes a review of recent empirical work on return predictability, value and other puzzles in the cross section, and equity premium puzzles and their resolution. Written to be a summary for academics and professionals as well as a textbook, this book condenses and advances recent scholarship in financial economics.","Mathematical finance Arbitrage pricing theory Capital asset pricing model Financial economics Beta Intertemporal CAPM Discounting Black–Scholes model Roll's critique Factor theory","Finance","Risk"

On that day a French doctoral student, Louis Bachelier, successfully defended his thesis Théorie de la Spéculation at the Sorbonne. The jury, while noting that the topic was """"far away from those usually considered by our candidates,"""" appreciated its high degree of originality. This book provides a new translation, with commentary and background, of Bachelier's seminal work.  Bachelier's thesis is a remarkable document on two counts. In mathematical terms Bachelier's achievement was to introduce many of the concepts of what is now known as stochastic analysis. His purpose, however, was to give a theory for the valuation of financial options. He came up with a formula that is both correct on its own terms and surprisingly close to the Nobel Prize-winning solution to the option pricing problem by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973, the first decisive advance since 1900.  Aside from providing an accurate and accessible translation, this book traces the twin-track intellectual history of stochastic analysis and financial economics, starting with Bachelier in 1900 and ending in the 1980s when the theory of option pricing was substantially complete. The story is a curious one. The economic side of Bachelier's work was ignored until its rediscovery by financial economists more than fifty years later. The results were spectacular: within twenty-five years the whole theory was worked out, and a multibillion-dollar global industry of option trading had emerged.""","Louis Bachelier Mathematical finance Option Stochastic calculus Financial economics Fischer Black Quantitative analyst","Finance","Risk"

The asset pricing results are based on the three increasingly restrictive assumptions: absence of arbitrage, single-agent optimality, and equilibrium. These results are unified with two key concepts, state prices and martingales. Technicalities are given relatively little emphasis, so as to draw connections between these concepts and to make plain the similarities between discrete and continuous-time models. Readers will be particularly intrigued by this latest edition's most significant new feature: a chapter on corporate securities that offers alternative approaches to the valuation of corporate debt. Also, while much of the continuous-time portion of the theory is based on Brownian motion, this third edition introduces jumps--for example, those associated with Poisson arrivals--in order to accommodate surprise events such as bond defaults. Applications include term-structure models, derivative valuation, and hedging methods. Numerical methods covered include Monte Carlo simulation and finite-difference solutions for partial differential equations. Each chapter provides extensive problem exercises and notes to the literature. A system of appendixes reviews the necessary mathematical concepts. And references have been updated throughout.

Linear Factor Models covers an important area for Quantitative Analysts/Investment Managers who are developing Quantitative Investment Strategies. Linear factor models (LFM) are part of modern investment processes that include asset valuation, portfolio theory and applications, linear factor models and applications, dynamic asset allocation strategies, portfolio performance measurement, risk management, international perspectives, and the use of derivatives.  The book develops the building blocks for one of the most important theories of asset pricing - Linear Factor Modelling. Within this framework, we can include other asset pricing theories such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), arbitrage pricing theory and various pricing formulae for derivatives and option prices.  As a bare minimum, the reader of this book must have a working knowledge of basic calculus, simple optimisation and elementary statistics. In particular, the reader must be comfortable with the algebraic manipulation of means, variances (and covariances) of linear combination(s) of random variables.

Why did no one see it coming? And how did our banks lose so much of our money? What's being done to sort out the banking industry? And will it work? These are the questions that industry experts Adrian Docherty and Franck Viort cover in Better Banking: Understanding and Addressing the Failures in Risk Management, Governance and Regulation. They give a clear and thorough run-through of some of the key concepts and developments in banking, to enable the reader to understand better this vital yet perilous industry. Without excessive detail or jargon, they explain the most important issues in risk management, regulation and governance and build a comprehensive description of how failings in these areas resulted in the current financial crisis. In order to make the diagnosis clear, the authors illustrate their descriptions with a series of informative case studies. The book revolves around a critique of the current regulatory developments, which the authors feel will be ineffective in fixing the structural flaws in banking. Crucially, and as the title of the book suggests, they set out their own series of proposals to contribute to the development of a better, safer and more effective banking industry. Docherty and Viort's book fills an important gap in the literature on banking and its role in the current financial crisis. It is at once a history, a primer, a critique and a manifesto.

A large existing literature (e.g., Engle, 1982; Rossi, 1995) models volatility as an average of past shocks, possibly with a noise component. This approach often has difficulty capturing sharp discontinuities and large changes in financial volatility. Their research has shown the advantages of modelling volatility as subject to abrupt regime changes of heterogeneous durations. Using the intuition that some economic phenomena are long-lasting while others are more transient, they permit regimes to have varying degrees of persistence. By drawing on insights from the use of multifractals in the natural sciences and mathematics, they show how to construct high-dimensional regime-switching models that are easy to estimate, and substantially outperform some of the best traditional forecasting models such as GARCH. The goal of their book is to popularize the approach by presenting these exciting new developments to a wider audience. They emphasize both theoretical and empirical applications, beginning with a style that is easily accessible and intuitive in early chapters, and extending to the most rigorous continuous-time and equilibrium pricing formulations in final chapters.","Mathematical finance Fractals Options Technical analysis Markov switching multifractal Volatility Multifractal system Stochastic volatility","Finance","Risk"

Though relatively simple in theory, understanding and making practical use of the equity risk premium concept has been dauntingly complex-until now. In The Equity Risk Premium, financial advisor, author, and scholar Bradford Cornell makes accessible for the first time an authoritative explanation of the equity risk premium and how it works in the real world. Step-by-step, his lucid, nontechnical presentation leads the reader to a new and more enlightened basis for making asset allocation choices. Cornell begins his analysis by looking at the equity risk premium in the light of stock market history. He examines the use of historical data in estimating future stock market performance, including the historical relationship between stock returns and risk premium, the impact of survival bias, and the effect of long-horizon stock and bond returns. Using the stock market boom of the 1990s as a case study, Cornell demonstrates what equity risk premium analysis can tell us about whether stock prices are high or low, whether the stock market itself may have changed, and whether indeed a new economic paradigm of higher earnings and dividend growth is now in place. Cornell analyzes forward-looking estimates of the equity risk premium through the lens of various competing approaches and assesses the relative merits of each. Among those scrutinized are the Discounted Cash Flow model, the Kaplan-Rubeck study, the Welch survey, and the Fama-French Aggregate IRR analysis. His insights on risk aversion theory, on the types of risk that have been rewarded over time, and on changing investor demographics all supply the sophisticated investor with important pieces of the risk premium puzzle. In his invaluable summing up of the equity risk premium and the long-run outlook for common stocks, Cornell weighs the evidence and assays the impact of a lower equity risk premium in the future-and its profound implications for investments, corporate decision making, and retirement planning. The product of years of serious analysis and hard-won insights, The Equity Risk Premium is essential reading for institutional investors, money managers, corporate financial officers, and all others who require a higher level of market analysis.","Stock market Corporate finance Financial markets Behavioral finance Equity premium puzzle Financial risk Risk premium Equity risk Investment Stock Finance Risk","Finance","Risk"

These lie in the hidden potential of real assets, such as income from our livelihoods and homes. But these ''ordinary riches,'' so fundamental to our well-being, are increasingly exposed to the pervasive risks of a rapidly changing global economy. This compelling and important new book presents a fresh vision for hedging risk and securing our economic future.

Just as developments in insuring risks to life, health, and catastrophe have given us a quality of life unimaginable a century ago, so Shiller's plan for securing crucial assets promises to substantially enrich our condition. Once again providing an enormous service, Shiller gives us a powerful means to convert our ordinary riches into a level of economic security, equity, and growth never before seen. And once again, what Robert Shiller says should be read and heeded by anyone with a stake in the economy.","Actuarial science Security Management Risk Robert J.

Derived from the authors teaching notes and years spent training practitioners in risk management techniques, it brings together the three key disciplines of finance, statistics and modeling (programming), to provide a thorough grounding in risk management techniques.Written by renowned risk expert Jon Danielsson, the book begins with an introduction to financial markets and market prices, volatility clusters, fat tails and nonlinear dependence. It then goes on to present volatility forecasting with both univatiate and multivatiate methods, discussing the various methods used by industry, with a special focus on the GARCH family of models. The evaluation of the quality of forecasts is discussed in detail. Next, the main concepts in risk and models to forecast risk are discussed, especially volatility, value-at-risk and expected shortfall. The focus is both on risk in basic assets such as stocks and foreign exchange, but also calculations of risk in bonds and options, with analytical methods such as delta-normal VaR and duration-normal VaR and Monte Carlo simulation. The book then moves on to the evaluation of risk models with methods like backtesting, followed by a discussion on stress testing. The book concludes by focussing on the forecasting of risk in very large and uncommon events with extreme value theory and considering the underlying assumptions behind almost every risk model in practical use – that risk is exogenous – and what happens when those assumptions are violated.Every method presented brings together theoretical discussion and derivation of key equations and a discussion of issues in practical implementation. Each method is implemented in both MATLAB and R, two of the most commonly used mathematical programming languages for risk forecasting with which the reader can implement the models illustrated in the book.The book includes four appendices. The first introduces basic concepts in statistics and financial time series referred to throughout the book. The second and third introduce R and MATLAB, providing a discussion of the basic implementation of the software packages. And the final looks at the concept of maximum likelihood, especially issues in implementation and testing.The book is accompanied by a website - www.financialriskforecasting.com – which features downloadable code as used in the book.","Mathematical finance Actuarial science Financial risk Market risk Volatility Quantitative analyst Value at risk Expected shortfall Option Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity Financial risk modeling Historical simulation","Finance","Risk"

This is the case that Riccardo Rebonato makes in Plight of the Fortune Tellers--and coming from someone who is both an experienced market professional and an academic, this heresy is worth listening to. Rebonato forcefully argues that we must restore genuine decision making to our financial planning, and he shows us how to do it using probability, experimental psychology, and decision theory. This is the only way to effectively manage financial risk in a manner congruent with how human beings actually react to chance. Rebonato challenges us to rethink the standard wisdom about probability in financial-risk management. Risk managers have become obsessed with measuring risk and believe that these quantitative results by themselves can guide sound financial choices--but they can't. In this book, Rebonato offers a radical yet surprisingly commonsense solution, one that seeks to remind us that managing risk comes down to real people making decisions under uncertainty.

Managing Operational Risk in Financial Markets outlines the major issues for risk management and focuses on operational risk as a key activity in managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis. While risk management had always been an integral part of financial activity, the 1990s has seen the requirement for risk management establish itself as a key function within banks and other financial institutions. With greater emphasis on ensuring that money is not lost through adverse market conditions, counterparty failure or inappropriate controls, systems or people, risk management has become a discipline in its own right. Managing risk is now THE paramount topic within the financial sector. Recurring major losses through the 1990s has shocked financial institutions into placing much greater emphasis on risk management and controls. The collapse of Barings and losses made by Metallgescellschaft, Orange County, Diawa and Sumitomo as a result of a lack of procedures, systems or managerial control has demonstrated to organisations the need to broaden the scope of their risk management activity from merely looking at market and credit risk. This has brought into focus the need for managing operational risk. Operational risk can only be managed on an enterprise wide basis as it includes the entire process of policies, culture, procedures, expertise and systems that an institution needs in order to manage all the risks resulting from its financial transactions. In fact, in order to effectively manage market and credit risks it is necessary to have the relevant skills and expertise in the staff, technical and organisational infrastructure, as well as monitoring and control systems. As all of these are components of operational risk, it then becomes apparent that an integrated risk management approach needs to focus on operational risk.","Actuarial science Risk Security Auditing Risk management Operational risk Financial risk Internal control IT risk Enterprise risk management IT risk management","Finance","Risk"

Each new piece of information influences the prices of assets and their correlations with each other, and as the system rapidly changes, so too do correlation forecasts. This fast-evolving environment presents econometricians with the challenge of forecasting dynamic correlations, which are essential inputs to risk measurement, portfolio allocation, derivative pricing, and many other critical financial activities. In Anticipating Correlations, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Engle introduces an important new method for estimating correlations for large systems of assets: Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC).  	Engle demonstrates the role of correlations in financial decision making, and addresses the economic underpinnings and theoretical properties of correlations and their relation to other measures of dependence. He compares DCC with other correlation estimators such as historical correlation, exponential smoothing, and multivariate GARCH, and he presents a range of important applications of DCC. Engle presents the asymmetric model and illustrates it using a multicountry equity and bond return model. He introduces the new FACTOR DCC model that blends factor models with the DCC to produce a model with the best features of both, and illustrates it using an array of U.S. large-cap equities.

René Carmona brings together a who's who of leading experts in the field to provide the definitive introduction for students, scholars, and researchers. Until recently, financial mathematicians and engineers developed pricing and hedging procedures that assumed complete markets. But markets are generally incomplete, and it may be impossible to hedge against all sources of randomness. Indifference Pricing offers cutting-edge procedures developed under more realistic market assumptions.  	The book begins by introducing the concept of indifference pricing in the simplest possible models of discrete time and finite state spaces where duality theory can be exploited readily. It moves into a more technical discussion of utility indifference pricing for diffusion models, and then addresses problems of optimal design of derivatives by extending the indifference pricing paradigm beyond the realm of utility functions into the realm of dynamic risk measures. Focus then turns to the applications, including portfolio optimization, the pricing of defaultable securities, and weather and commodity derivatives.

Academic books are typically concerned primarily with measurement techniques, and devote only a small section to describing the applications, usually without discussing the problems that changing organizational processes in banks may have on business units' behaviour. Practitioners' books are often based on a single experience, presenting the approach that has been pursued by a single bank, but often do not adequately evaluate that approach. In actual practice, the choice of how to use Value at Risk and risk-adjusted performance measures has no single optimal solution, but requires effective decision making that can identify the solution that is consistent with the bank's style of management and coordination mechanisms, and often with characteristics of individual business units as well.  In this book, Francesco Saita of Bocconi University argues that even though risk measurement techniques have greatly improved in recent years for market, credit and now also operational risk, capital management and capital allocation decisions are far from becoming purely technical and mechanical. On one hand, decisions about capital management must consider handling different capital constraints (e.g. regulatory vs. economic capital ) and face remarkable difficulties in providing a measure of """"aggregated"""" Value at Risk (i.e. a measure that considers the overall value at risk of the bank after diversification across risk types). On the other hand, the aim of using capital more efficiently through capital allocation cannot be achieved only through a sort of centralized asset allocation process, but rather by designing a Value at Risk limit system and a risk-adjusted performance measurement system that are designed to provide the right incentives to individual business units.  This connection between sophisticated and cutting edge risk measurement techniques and practical bank decision making about capital management and capital allocation make this book unique and provide readers with a depth of academic and theoretical expertise combined with practical and real-world understanding of bank structure, organizational constraints, and decisionmaking processes.""","Actuarial science Financial risk Risk Risk-adjusted return on capital Operational risk Risk management Economic capital Financial risk modeling Value at risk Managerial risk accounting CAMELS rating system","Finance","Risk"

Considerable emphasis is also given to the key controls and the importance of control functions, audit and risk management groups and policy. Case studies are used to effectively demonstrate 'success' and 'failure'. In the financial services industry risk is a constant threat to organizations of all sizes and to the markets themselves. Many industry 'events' have shown how dangerous it is when a business operates in an uncontrolled way, particularly when the lack of control was not evident to the management of the business until it was too late. Controls, procedures and risk are occupying more and more management time. The responsibility to manage the risks lies with the whole operations team. If it is successful in fulfilling this role the overall risk of the business is reduced, if it is not successful the consequences may be severe. In this book the author has deliberately focussed on the practical side of risk, controls and procedures, rather than analyse the Basel Capital Accord and the capital requirements etc.(however, the Accord and updates are contained in the Appendices). Operations teams need to be aware of risk but not overwhelmed by it. Risk management within, and by, the operations function is the focus of this book. From day-to-day risk to wider risk implications the operations function is reviewed to show the sources and implications of risk situations.","Actuarial science Risk Security Management Project management Risk management IT risk management Operational risk Enterprise risk management NIST Special Publication 800-53","Finance","Risk"

The book outlines basic actuarial valuation concepts and then presents actuarial funding and valuation methods for defined benefit plans, and discusses their relationship to other types of pension plans. Optimal funding methodologies are developed in simple deterministic and in stochastic cases.  	The question of measurement of rate of return of a fund is analyzed in detail, pointing out how the choice of a market index affects it. The problem of stability of the value of liabilities is analyzed as well. Modern investment theory, including equilibrium and arbitrage models, is used to discuss ways to value both marketable and non-marketable assets, as well as liabilities. All commonly used methodologies of valuation of assets are listed and analyzed. Finally, financial risk management for pension plans is presented in detail, with emphasis on applicable asset-liability management methodologies. This portion of the book starts with the basics: duration, convexity, immunization, and develops alternative immunization methodologies, as well as other risk management tools, such as Value-at-Risk, Risk-Based-Capital, and shortfall constraint approach.  	A new optimal methodology, an alternative to classical immunization, is developed, and shown to be strikingly similar to conservative management approaches used by practitioners. Throughout the book, all concepts and methodologies are illustrated with examples and exercises, including past problems from the Society of Actuaries and Casualty Actuarial Society professional examinations (used with permission).","Insurance Actuarial science Risk Financial services Personal finance Actuary Finance Risk management Pension Asset liability management Defined benefit pension plan Immunization","Finance","Risk"

Its detailed coverage of a broad range of topics is ideally suited for use in advanced undergraduate and introductory graduate courses either as a self-contained text, or the introductory chapters combined with a selection of later chapters can represent core reading in courses on macroeconomics, insurance, portfolio choice, or asset pricing.

After examining these decisions in their one-period setting, they devote most of the book to a multiperiod context, which adds the long-term perspective most risk management analyses require. Each chapter concludes with a discussion of the relevant literature and a set of problems.

Should asset classes be represented by market-cap-weighted indexes or should other principles, such as fundamental weights, be used?  		How do actively managed funds fit into asset-class mixes?

The author examines the roles of clearing houses, central counterparties, central securities depositories and the custodians, as well as, assessing the impact on the workflow and procedures in the operations function at banks, brokers and institutions. The changes that are taking place in the industry are explored and the impact for operations managers and supervisors assessed. Clearing, settlement and custody is at the heart of everything that happens in the financial markets.   The evolution of clearing and settlement is one that is still happening and as such, it is impacting on the operations function through both new practices but also, increasingly, in terms of regulation, risk and reputation. In essence the efficient clearing and settlement operation is managing risk, not because it is a direct part of the process but more because it is a bi-product. The routine procedures relate to reconciliation and record keeping. If these are performed efficiently and accurately it will result in accurate records of activity and profit and loss.   The settlement process is a key element in identifying and correcting errors made by dealers and traders. Failure to identify the error or act promptly will result in potentially serious financial loss, as well as worrying audit and the regulators. In addition to these concerns the financial service sector is also undergoing a massive rationalization of the structure of clearing and settlement and seeking the twin goals of automation and shortening settlement cycles. The challenge for operations managers is considerable: manage costs, eradicate inefficiencies, create an environment to be competitive, and implement the procedures to meet future changes that will occur.   In this book the author looks at some of the different roles, the processes and procedures, and the key issues, in order to help those in operations meet the challenge.","Systemic risk Stock market Financial markets Payment systems Financial services Clearing Settlement Central securities depository Security Central Counterparty Clearing Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation","Finance","Financial instruments"

The methodological rigor, scope, and sophistication of their state-of-the-art account is unparalleled, and its singularly in-depth treatment of pricing and credit derivatives further illuminates a problem that has drawn much attention in an era when financial institutions the world over are revising their credit management strategies. Duffie and Singleton offer critical assessments of alternative approaches to credit-risk modeling, while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current practice. Their approach blends in-depth discussions of the conceptual foundations of modeling with extensive analyses of the empirical properties of such credit-related time series as default probabilities, recoveries, ratings transitions, and yield spreads. Both the """"structura"""" and """"reduced-form"""" approaches to pricing defaultable securities are presented, and their comparative fits to historical data are assessed. The authors also provide a comprehensive treatment of the pricing of credit derivatives, including credit swaps, collateralized debt obligations, credit guarantees, lines of credit, and spread options. Not least, they describe certain enhancements to current pricing and management practices that, they argue, will better position financial institutions for future changes in the financial markets. Credit Risk is an indispensable resource for risk managers, traders or regulators dealing with financial products with a significant credit risk component, as well as for academic researchers and students.""","United States housing bubble Credit derivative Credit risk Probability of default Collateralized debt obligation Derivative Credit default swap Certificate in Quantitative Finance","Finance","Financial instruments"

Given the variety and the complexity of the materials the book covers, the author sorts through a vast array of topics in a subjective way, relying upon more than twenty years of experience as a market practitioner. The book only requires the reader to be knowledgeable in the basics of algebra and statistics.  		The Mathematical formulae are only fully proven when the proof brings some useful insight. These formulae are translated from algebra into plain English to aid understanding as the vast majority of practitioners involved in the financial markets are not required to compute or calculate prices or sensitivities themselves as they have access to data providers. Thus, the intention of this book is for the practitioner to gain a deeper understanding of these calculations, both for a safety reason – it is better to understand what is behind the data we manipulate – and secondly being able to appreciate the magnitude of the prices we are confronted with and being able to draft a rough calculation, aside of the market data.  		The author has avoided excessive formalism where possible. Formalism is securing the outputs of research, but may, in other circumstances, burden the understanding by non-mathematicians; an example of this case is in the chapter dedicated to the basis of stochastic calculus.  		The book is divided into two parts:  		-          First, the deterministic world, starting from the yield curve building and related calculations (spot rates, forward rates, discrete versus continuous compounding, etc.), and continuing with spot instruments valuation (short term rates, bonds, currencies and stocks) and forward instruments valuation (forward forex, FRAs and variants, swaps & futures);  		-          Second, the probabilistic world, starting with the basis of stochastic calculus and the alternative approach of ARMA to GARCH, and continuing with derivative pricing: options, second generation options, volatility, credit derivatives;  		-          This second part is completed by a chapter dedicated to market performance & risk measures, and a chapter widening the scope of quantitative models beyond the Gaussian hypothesis and evidencing the potential troubles linked to derivative pricing models.",NA,"Finance","Financial instruments"

In the 1990s, it became possible to do so by answering 15 general knowledge questions correctly or by picking six numbers in the National Lottery. And for a brief moment in late 1999 and early 2000, it seemed possible to make a million by setting up, working for, or even investing in an Internet company.  This book examines the immense cultural changes that lie behind these changes. Government restrictions on gambling and TV quiz show prizes have been swept away. The growth of venture capital and share options have vastly increased the attractiveness of establishing, and working for, new businesses.  But it also warns of the dangers when investors treat the stock market as a slightly more complex version of the National Lottery. Fortunes were made and lost as companies with no profits and uncertain futures saw their share prices soar and then collapse. First-time investors were encouraged into the stock market by the government and by the financial services industry but were thrown in at the deep end--with only some dubious newspaper and Internet bulletin board tips to guide them. It is a cautionary tale of greed and delusion--how the pursuit of easy money led many Britons astray.

This edition updates the widely respected classic with new material by Martin L.

In an era of calculators and computers, some of these important underlying principles are not always grasped thoroughly by market participants. Investors, traders, and analysts who want to sharpen their ability to recall and apply these fundamentals will find this book the perfect concise resource.

Shiller returns to the topic that gained him international fame: market volatility. Shiller breaks new ground in this second edition by laying out in even clearer and starker terms the market excesses that continue to destabilize the economy and disrupt our lives. Having predicted the stock market collapse that began just one month after the first edition was published, he now expands the book to cover other markets that have become volatile, particularly the recently red-hot housing market. He includes a full chapter on domestic and international housing prices in historical perspective. Shiller amasses impressive evidence to support his argument that the recent housing market boom bears many similarities to the stock market bubble of the late 1990s, and may eventually be followed by declining home prices for years to come. After stocks plummeted when the bubble burst in 2000, investors moved their money into housing. This precipitated the inflated real estate prices not only in America, but around the world, Shiller maintains. Hence, irrational exuberance did not disappear-it merely reappeared in other settings. Building on the original edition, Shiller draws out the psychological origins of volatility in financial markets, this time folding real estate into his analysis. He broadens the evidence that investing in capital markets of all kinds in the modern free-market economy is inherently unstable-subject to the profoundly human influences captured in Alan Greenspan's now-famous phrase, """"irrational exuberance."""" The ultimate solution to this troubling condition, he maintains, would involve better-designed public institutions such as a revamped social security system, new forms of insurance to protect people's incomes and homes, and a broader array of investment options. As was true of its predecessor, the second edition of Irrational Exuberance is destined to be widely read, discussed, and debated.""","Behavioral finance Economic bubbles Robert J.

He supplements his narrative, which makes use of rich source material, with observations he has made in South Korea, where he spent more than ten years from the 1970s to the 1990s, and where he had access to politicians and opinion leaders. The book starts by describing how the Hermit Kingdom was exposed to the greed of foreign powers at the end of the 19th century and how it became the victim of imperialistic Japan, then account is given of the country's division and the hardening of that division through the Korean War. The rule of the military and the final triumph of civilian democrats in South Korea are analyzed in much detail. One chapter is devoted to the rise and intermittent decline of the South Korean economy. The history of North Korea under Kim II Sung and under his son is told, before the foreign relations of both Koreas are explained.

Once a marginal source of funds, securitization is now an essential corporate funding technique widely adopted by financial and industrial companies throughout the world to finance both working capital and capital budgets. It is also used as a risk-management tool and a source of liquidity. Securitization has been adapted to fund corporate acquisitions, to capitalize future streams of revenue, and to liquidate pools of nonperforming loans.  With examples from companies such as GE Capital, Ford Motor Credit, Countrywide Home Loans, and D&K Healthcare, The Securitization Markets Handbook provides descriptions of all major classes of asset-backed securities and offers a practice-oriented commentary on trends in securitization and the value of asset- and mortgage-backed securities across industries and throughout the global markets.  The authors approach the topic from both sides of the market: the supply side, where assets are securitized and mortgage- and asset-backed securities are issued, and the demand side, where investors choose which classes of mortgage and asset-backed securities will enhance their portfolios or serve as efficient hedges. The book’s detailed explanations and practical examples make it a valuable guide both for experienced money managers trying to put a securitization strategy into place and for those new to securitization looking to acquire a broad and strong foundation in the subject.","Structured finance United States housing bubble Fixed income securities Mortgage-backed security Mortgage industry of the United States Securitization Asset-backed security Debt Secondary mortgage market Fannie Mae Mortgage loan Credit enhancement","Finance","Financial instruments"

This generic heading encompasses a seemingly endless array of finance instruments, including convertible bonds, mandatory convertibles, reverse convertibles, preferred shares, ELKS, DECS and LYONs, Within each one of these instruments are found a wide range of variations and features. These include reset, negative pledge, screw and forced conversion clauses, as well as step up coupons, call schedules, call options with soft and hard protection, etc,  The range of possibilities can seem bewildering, but it is this very flexibility which proves a huge attraction for investors, issuers and financial institutions. On the sell side companies issue these securities and corporate service departments advise on the type of options to include in them. On the buy side, investment managers seek to build portfolios with limited risk exposure using these securities and hedge funds utilize arbitrage opportunities between the convertible bond and the common share.  The opportunities are endless but the seemingly labyrinthine complexities can prove daunting. The Handbook of Hybrid Instruments helps steer a clear path through the maze. Izzy Nelken has drawn together a team of experts to provide in-depth analysis of many o key issues that both sellers and buyers require in order to operate effectively and profitably.  A general introduction is followed by specific information on key clauses and variations, valuation methods, the impact on a firm's value following the public issuance of convertibles, details on when an issuer should call a convertible and the impact of these provisions on the price, the difficult requirement of input data to make sense of the models, indexes and reset convertibles. Finally, a highly useful glossary is provided of all the key terms used in this field.  An analytical CD is also provided with the book, containing sample software of ConvB++.

In Fixed-Income Securities and Derivatives Handbook, respected practitioner Moorad Choudhry provides a concise and accessible overview of the main elements of the markets, the techniques used, and their applications. Covering a wide range of market instruments, the book examines both simple and complex products and the mathematics behind them.  	Analyzing both cash and derivative products, Choudhry provides insight into market conventions with case studies demonstrating how the markets really work. The book features an introduction to yield-curve models, curve-fitting techniques, a look at option-adjusted spread, index-linked bond analytics, and a range of other applications of value in the fixed-income markets. Choudhry’s unique focus on the international nature of these instruments makes the techniques and applications appropriate to every debt capital market.  	Whether new to the field or simply in need of a refresher on recent developments, the practitioner will find Fixed-Income Securities and Derivatives Handbook a resource to have close by. 	 ","Fixed income analysis Fixed income market Mathematical finance Yield curve Options Interest rate swap Bond valuation Bond duration Fixed income Derivative Option-adjusted spread Bond","Finance","Financial instruments"

After looking at the maritime environment, the specific challenges that the maritime community faces are examined. These challenges include maritime boundary and territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the force modernization of three Northeast Asian navies, and the spectre of maritime terrorism.

Frock's story introduces all the players--FedEx's resourceful and resilient leaders and employees--and shows how these remarkable individuals gave Fred Smith's original concept wings and, through flexibility, creativity, and commitment, made a fledgling startup into one of the great success stories in modern business.

The book presents theory without unnecessary abstraction; quantitative techniques with a minimum of mathematics; and conventions at a useful level of detail.  	The book begins with an overview of global fixed income markets and continues with the fundamentals, namely, arbitrage pricing, interest rates, risk metrics, and term structure models to price contingent claims. Subsequent chapters cover individual markets and securities: repo, rate and bond forwards and futures, interest rate and basis swaps, credit markets, fixed income options, and mortgage-backed-securities.  	Fixed Income Securities, Third Edition is full of examples, applications, and case studies. Practically every quantitative concept is illustrated through real market data. This practice-oriented approach makes the book particularly useful for the working professional.  	This third edition is a considerable revision and expansion of the second. Most examples have been updated. The chapters on fixed income options and mortgage-backed securities have been considerably expanded to include a broader range of securities and valuation methodologies. Also, three new chapters have been added: the global overview of fixed income markets; a chapter on corporate bonds and credit default swaps; and a chapter on discounting with bases, which is the foundation for the relatively recent practice of discounting swap cash flows with curves based on money market rates.

However, growth in the non-Government side of the market for Japan has been a more recent phenomenon and a goal of policymakers in Japan and Asia since 1997.  	These markets are now second only to those in the United States and dominate the issuance market in the Asian Pacific region. The latter does not surprise since Japan is second only to the United States in debt issuance globally and in recent years has had one of the world's largest government bond and interest rate derivatives markets. However, these relationships are not static and the portfolio flows between Japanese fixed income markets, the Asia Pacific region and the rest of the world. This remains a matter of considerable importance for institutional investors, central banks and governments.  	The efforts of the authors who have contributed to this volume will measurably add to our understanding of the Japanese Fixed Income Market. This volume is structured into four parts: Macroeconomic Environmental Development, Credit Risk Measures and Management, Interest Rate Analysis and Market Integration sections. There are seventeen chapters in the volume with thirty-one authors, many of whom are prominent in academic and practitioner aspects of the Fixed Income markets field, contributing their insight to this volume.","Fixed income market Bond Fixed income Central bank Financial market Inter-dealer broker","Finance","Financial instruments"

Using the market approach, price-related indicators such as price to earnings, sales and book values are utilised. An ever-present problem however, is that different valuation multiples and valuation methodologies tend to provide the analyst with contradictory outputs. The solution to this problem so far has been to claim that the market approach is more art than science, thus providing the analyst with the freedom to alter the multiples at their own discretion to reach a uniform value or range.  Valuation: The Market Approach puts an end to this problem, providing the reader with a rational scientific-based understanding and the necessary tools to perform a sound market approach valuation, or if reviewing such valuations, provide the tools to challenge the work of the arts-based senior experts.  	The book begins with an in-depth review of the basics; which is then applied in a detailed worked example. Step-by-step, the reader’s expertise is built towards a complete understanding and implementation of the market approach, not only on a standalone basis but also in relation to the DCF methodology.  	The book is aimed at the seasoned professional, but will also be invaluable to students as they apply their academic knowledge to the real world of valuation and M&A.

The industry has not solved the """"transparency"""" challenge--communicating risk to investors without disclosing proprietary information.  Hedge Fund Risk Fundamentals is the first book to bring these issues to the forefront. With clarity, concision, and minimal math, Richard Horwitz lays out the key components and the cutting-edge processes in the field of hedge fund risk management today. Against that backdrop, he presents a groundbreaking utility destined to set the standard for transparency and risk management within the hedge fund universe.  	You’ll learn why, when it comes to risk management, 1 + 1 = 1.41.

Rather than being traded through a centralized institution such as a stock exchange, OTC trades are negotiated privately between market participants who may be unaware of prices that are currently available elsewhere in the market. In these relatively opaque markets, investors can be in the dark about the most attractive available terms and who might be offering them. This opaqueness exacerbated the financial crisis, as regulators and market participants were unable to quickly assess the risks and pricing of these instruments.  Dark Markets offers a concise introduction to OTC markets by explaining key conceptual issues and modeling techniques, and by providing readers with a foundation for more advanced subjects in this field. Darrell Duffie covers the basic methods for modeling search and random matching in economies with many agents. He gives an overview of asset pricing in OTC markets with symmetric and asymmetric information, showing how information percolates through these markets as investors encounter each other over time.

In this trenchant book, best-selling economist Robert Shiller reveals the origins of this crisis and puts forward bold measures to solve it. He calls for an aggressive response--a restructuring of the institutional foundations of the financial system that will not only allow people once again to buy and sell homes with confidence, but will create the conditions for greater prosperity in America and throughout the deeply interconnected world economy. Shiller blames the subprime crisis on the irrational exuberance that drove the economy's two most recent bubbles--in stocks in the 1990s and in housing between 2000 and 2007. He shows how these bubbles led to the dangerous overextension of credit now resulting in foreclosures, bankruptcies, and write-offs, as well as a global credit crunch. To restore confidence in the markets, Shiller argues, bailouts are needed in the short run. But he insists that these bailouts must be targeted at low-income victims of subprime deals. In the longer term, the subprime solution will require leaders to revamp the financial framework by deploying an ambitious package of initiatives to inhibit the formation of bubbles and limit risks, including better financial information; simplified legal contracts and regulations; expanded markets for managing risks; home equity insurance policies; income-linked home loans; and new measures to protect consumers against hidden inflationary effects. This powerful book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how we got into the subprime mess--and how we can get out.","Financial crises Economic bubbles Systemic risk Debt Great Recession Robert J.

This book provides an introduction and overview for readers who seek an up-to-date reference to the central problems of the field and to the tools currently used to analyze them. The book is aimed at researchers and students in finance, at quantitative analysts in banks and other financial institutions, and at regulators interested in the modeling aspects of credit risk. David Lando considers the two broad approaches to credit risk analysis: that based on classical option pricing models on the one hand, and on a direct modeling of the default probability of issuers on the other. He offers insights that can be drawn from each approach and demonstrates that the distinction between the two approaches is not at all clear-cut. The book strikes a fruitful balance between quickly presenting the basic ideas of the models and offering enough detail so readers can derive and implement the models themselves. The discussion of the models and their limitations and five technical appendixes help readers expand and generalize the models themselves or to understand existing generalizations. The book emphasizes models for pricing as well as statistical techniques for estimating their parameters. Applications include rating-based modeling, modeling of dependent defaults, swap- and corporate-yield curve dynamics, credit default swaps, and collateralized debt obligations.","Stochastic processes United States housing bubble Markov models Markov processes Mathematical finance Credit default swap Markov chain Credit risk Derivative Quantitative analyst Collateralized debt obligation Jump process","Finance","Financial instruments"

Edited by leading thinkers in the field, The Handbook of Equity Derivatives, Revised Edition, assembles dozens of experts from universities and Wall Street to help the reader gain a practical grasp of the growing variety of financial instruments and how they work. Contributions from such respected authorities as Gary Gastineau, Mark Rubinstein, J.

The system is mainly driven by two related factors — inter-governmental decentralization and globalization. While economic decentralization since the 1980s has led to the formation of de facto federalism, globalization since the 1990s has accelerated this process and generated increasingly high pressure on the Chinese leadership to institutionalize de facto federalism by various measures of selective recentralization.","Political systems Federalism Political ideologies Decentralization Localism Canadian federalism Government Guangdong Draft:The Federalist Movement of Nigeria","Economics","Mathematics"

Accountability tells the story of Pete Williams, a hard-charging CEO, who meets Stan """"Kip"""" Kiplinger, a retired businessman, during a cross-country train trip. Pete's manufacturing business is in critical condition; productivity is falling. He's tried all the popular management approaches, but he can't get his people to be accountable for meeting their goals.  	Kip points out that every management system Pete has used is ultimately based on controlling people. Rather than encouraging people to be accountable, control-based systems discourage accountability by destroying people's sense of ownership of their job. Kip introduces Pete to a new way of leading people based on freedom-giving people the freedom to make their own choices and to do it their way. This doesn't mean anarchy; it means leadership expects everyone to act like an adult and take responsibility for his or her actions and their outcomes.

Until recently, however, economic research on this question either ignored people's uncertainty about their future productivities or imposed strong and unrealistic functional form restrictions on taxes. In response to these problems, the new dynamic public finance was developed to study the design of optimal taxes given only minimal restrictions on the set of possible tax instruments, and on the nature of shocks affecting people in the economy. In this book, Narayana Kocherlakota surveys and discusses this exciting new approach to public finance.  	An important book for advanced PhD courses in public finance and macroeconomics, The New Dynamic Public Finance provides a formal connection between the problem of dynamic optimal taxation and dynamic principal-agent contracting theory. This connection means that the properties of solutions to principal-agent problems can be used to determine the properties of optimal tax systems. The book shows that such optimal tax systems necessarily involve asset income taxes, which may depend in sophisticated ways on current and past labor incomes. It also addresses the implications of this new approach for qualitative properties of optimal monetary policy, optimal government debt policy, and optimal bequest taxes. In addition, the book describes computational methods for approximate calculation of optimal taxes, and discusses possible paths for future research.  	Narayana R.

The logic is so compelling that the models are widely used in policy, from banking, investments, and corporate finance to government. To what extent, however, can these models predict what actually happens in financial markets? In The Paradox of Asset Pricing, a leading financial researcher argues forcefully that the empirical record is weak at best. Peter Bossaerts undertakes the most thorough, technically sound investigation in many years into the scientific character of the pricing of financial assets. He probes this conundrum by modeling a decidedly volatile phenomenon that, he says, the world of finance has forgotten in its enthusiasm for the efficient markets hypothesis--speculation.  	   	Bossaerts writes that the existing empirical evidence may be tainted by the assumptions needed to make sense of historical field data or by reanalysis of the same data. To address the first problem, he demonstrates that one central assumption--that markets are efficient processors of information, that risk is a knowable quantity, and so on--can be relaxed substantially while retaining core elements of the existing methodology. The new approach brings novel insights to old data. As for the second problem, he proposes that asset pricing theory be studied through experiments in which subjects trade purposely designed assets for real money. This book will be welcomed by finance scholars and all those math--and statistics-minded readers interested in knowing whether there is science beyond the mathematics of finance.  	   	This book provided the foundation for subsequent journal articles that won two prestigious awards: the 2003 Journal of Financial Markets Best Paper Award and the 2004 Goldman Sachs Asset Management Best Research Paper for the Review of Finance.",NA,"Economics","Mathematics"

Both nodal and hierachic concepts of the FEM are examined. Reflecting the growing complexity and multiscale nature of current engineering and scientific problems, the author emphasizes higher-order finite element methods such as the spectral or hp-FEM.A solid introduction to the theory of PDEs and FEM contained in Chapters 1-4 serves as the core and foundation of the publication. Chapter 5 is devoted to modern higher-order methods for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that arise in the semidiscretization of time-dependent PDEs by the Method of Lines (MOL). Chapter 6 discusses fourth-order PDEs rooted in the bending of elastic beams and plates and approximates their solution by means of higher-order Hermite and Argyris elements. Finally, Chapter 7 introduces the reader to various PDEs governing computational electromagnetics and describes their finite element approximation, including modern higher-order edge elements for Maxwell's equations.The understanding of many theoretical and practical aspects of both PDEs and FEM requires a solid knowledge of linear algebra and elementary functional analysis, such as functions and linear operators in the Lebesgue, Hilbert, and Sobolev spaces. These topics are discussed with the help of many illustrative examples in Appendix A, which is provided as a service for those readers who need to gain the necessary background or require a refresher tutorial. Appendix B presents several finite element computations rooted in practical engineering problems and demonstrates the benefits of using higher-order FEM.Numerous finite element algorithms are written out in detail alongside implementation discussions. Exercises, including many that involve programming the FEM, are designed to assist the reader in solving typical problems in engineering and science.Specifically designed as a coursebook, this student-tested publication is geared to upper-level undergraduates and graduate students in all disciplines of computational engineeringand science. It is also a practical problem-solving reference for researchers, engineers, and physicists.","Partial differential equations Finite element method Numerical analysis Computational fluid dynamics Structural analysis Computational electromagnetics Differential equation Stiffness matrix Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations Numerical integration Equation Numerical partial differential equations","Economics","Mathematics"

Environmental concerns in China have triggered the publication of a number of books on the subject. However, very few books offer an in-depth case study of the environmental challenges in Shanghai. This book aims to explore the extent to which Shanghai has managed to cope with water supply as well as water quality control challenges in terms of its sociopolitical and economic development since 1990, with a special reference to the impact of social actors on water policy. The book focuses on the contributions from each actor in water policy — the most influential actor being the Shanghai government, private companies, environmental NGOs, Shanghai citizens, and international development agencies. The Shanghai water sector, in the recent few years, has been diversified through interactions between the Shanghai government and the newly emergent social actors. Consequently, water policy in Shanghai is influenced by multilateral interactions between these actors with their diverse interests and goals. The book will demonstrate the ways in which these actors in the Shanghai water sector have co-evolved through interactions to formulate a new mode of water policy reflecting the diverse interests of the social actors.","East China Shanghai Treaty of Nanking Yangtze River Delta Non-governmental organization Environmental protection GONGO Environmental policy Environmental governance in China Environmental governance","Economics","Mathematics"

However, today's global economy is too complicated to be explained by the traditional trade theories.  Recently, Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School introduced a new competitiveness theory, the so-called diamond model. He differentiated his theory from the traditional trade theories by arguing that national prosperity is not inherited, but created by choices; in other words, national wealth is not set by factor endowments, but created by strategic choices. He showed different choices of creating wealth, which had been quite limited in the world of traditional trade theories. His diamond model has lately been extended by several scholars.  This book highlights Porter's achievement by comparing it with those of traditional trade theorists and presents new developments of competitiveness theory. By discussing the """"before"""" and """"after"""" of Porter's theory, the authors provide the reader with a holistic picture of competitiveness theory.""","Competition Foreign direct investment Economic theories International trade Diamond model Michael Porter Adam Smith Competitiveness","Economics","Mathematics"

Trade is a cornerstone concept in economics, taught in all departments both in the United States and abroad. The past twenty years have seen a number of new theoretical approaches that are essential to any graduate international trade course, and will be of interest in development economics and other fields. Here, Robert Feenstra steps beyond theory to consider empirical evidence as well. He covers all the basic material including the Ricardian and Hecksher-Ohlin models, extension to many goods and factors, and the role of tariffs, quotas, and other trade policies; recent material including imperfect competition, outsourcing, political economy, multinationals, and endogenous growth; and new material including the gravity equation and the organization of the firm in international trade.  Throughout the book, special emphasis is placed on integrating the theoretical models with empirical evidence, and this is supplemented by theoretical and empirical exercises that appear with each chapter. Advanced International Trade is intended to bring readers to the forefront of knowledge in international trade and prepare them to undertake their own research. Both graduate students and faculty will find a wealth of topics that have previously only been covered in journal articles, and are dealt with here in a common and simple notation. In addition to known results, the book includes some particularly important unpublished results by various authors. Two appendices describe empirical methods applicable to research problems in international trade, methods that draw on (i) index numbers and (ii) discrete choice models.

More than that, Tiger Beer is seen as a cool brand, judging by the number of Cool Brand Leader awards that it has won in the United Kingdom. In fact, it is one of a handful of Singapore brands that have made waves internationally. Since 1939, Tiger Beer has consistently been winning the gold award at international beer competitions and has some 40 such awards under its belt. This achievement is made even more remarkable by the fact that it comes from a country that has no beer-brewing tradition. In this book, Jacky Tai explores how this Singapore beer has managed to do so well internationally despite being an Asian brew.

The “China Miracle” has been accompanied by soaring income inequality and rising social tensions, over-taxing China’s resource base and contributing to an environmental crisis. Despite substantial improvement in the standard of living and other social indicators, China’s leaders have, in the aftermath of the Tiananmen crackdown, steadfastly held back the opening up of the political system. In this volume, contributors from the disciplines of economics, political science, and sociology examine how existing institutions, broadly defined, might have exacerbated tensions in China's evolving economy, society and polity as well as how institutional developments have been introduced to deal with existing or emerging conflicts and tensions.","Chinese law Hukou system Poverty reduction China Decentralization Dali Yang","Economics","Mathematics"

In Analysis of Evolutionary Processes, Fabio Dercole and Sergio Rinaldi have written the first comprehensive book on Adaptive Dynamics (AD), a quantitative modeling approach that explicitly links evolutionary changes to demographic ones. The book shows how the so-called AD canonical equation can answer questions of paramount interest in biology, engineering, and the social sciences, especially economics.  	After introducing the basics of evolutionary processes and classifying available modeling approaches, Dercole and Rinaldi give a detailed presentation of the derivation of the AD canonical equation, an ordinary differential equation that focuses on evolutionary processes driven by rare and small innovations. The authors then look at important features of evolutionary dynamics as viewed through the lens of AD. They present their discovery of the first chaotic evolutionary attractor, which calls into question the common view that coevolution produces exquisitely harmonious adaptations between species. And, opening up potential new lines of research by providing the first application of AD to economics, they show how AD can explain the emergence of technological variety.  	Analysis of Evolutionary Processes will interest anyone looking for a self-contained treatment of AD for self-study or teaching, including graduate students and researchers in mathematical and theoretical biology, applied mathematics, and theoretical economics.","Evolutionary dynamics Evolutionary biology Evolution Evolutionary invasion analysis Evolutionary game theory Mathematical and theoretical biology Chaos theory Bifurcation theory Natural selection Biology Outline of evolution","Economics","Mathematics"

At the turn of the century, the Chinese economy faces a series of challenges to sustain its growth and stability. The two-decade-long rapid growth has effectively strengthened China's economic power and raised its people's standard of living. It has also transformed China from a centrally planned command economy into a """"socialist market economy"""", which operates increasingly in line with capitalist norms. Major structural problems, however, remain and are growing acute. Weakness in the fiscal system breeds rent seeking at the local level and causes tension in the state budget. The flawed financial institutions and the biased ownership structure continue to distort resource allocation and cause huge efficiency losses. Inter-provincial and inter-regional disparity is reaching a level that threatens national unity and social stability. As China joins the World Trade Organization and becomes more integrated into the world economy, it urgently needs to improve the domestic business environment and to beef up indigenous industries for foreign competition. This volume is a collection of papers written by scholars at the East Asian Institute to address those problems during the period 1999–2001. The authors, with their knowledge and experience in China studies, provide in-depth observations and professional analyses of some of the most important issues for the Chinese economy at the turn of the century. Some of the observations and analyses lead to enlightening policy recommendations. The solid scholarship combined with the policy orientation of these papers will appeal greatly to researchers in academia, governments and other institutions.

Chinese ruling elites adopted this pragmatic approach so they could ensure that the ideal could always approximate China’s reality. This is a revised edition of a study undertaken to explain what happened during one of the worst periods of division in Chinese history. What were the key factors that helped the centripetal forces to get back to the imperial norm?

In February of that year Deng Xiaoping passed away, thus marking the end of an era. Shortly after, the post-Deng Chinese leadership under Jiang Zemin had to mobilise great efforts to ensure the smooth resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong on June 30. This was then followed by intensive preparation for the holding of the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in September, which set national priorities for China's medium- and long-term development as well as decided on the core team of younger leaders responsible for leading China into the 21st century.  China is in the midst of great political, economic and social changes, which will intensify each other on account of their speed and scale. History has never before witnessed such a huge country as China industrialising and transforming itself so rapidly and so extensively. Accordingly, China's success or failure in its domestic development carries serious regional and international implications. There is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how soon in the next century China will become the world's most powerful economy. But what is happening in China today has already impinged on many aspects of life for people in the Asia-Pacific region, either in terms of growing trade and investment opportunities from China or in terms of regional security. This volume is largely based on public lectures and seminar papers by academic visitors and scholars at the East Asian Institute.

Andrzej Ruszczynski, a leading expert in the optimization of nonlinear stochastic systems, integrates the theory and the methods of nonlinear optimization in a unified, clear, and mathematically rigorous fashion, with detailed and easy-to-follow proofs illustrated by numerous examples and figures.  	The book covers convex analysis, the theory of optimality conditions, duality theory, and numerical methods for solving unconstrained and constrained optimization problems. It addresses not only classical material but also modern topics such as optimality conditions and numerical methods for problems involving nondifferentiable functions, semidefinite programming, metric regularity and stability theory of set-constrained systems, and sensitivity analysis of optimization problems.  	Based on a decade's worth of notes the author compiled in successfully teaching the subject, this book will help readers to understand the mathematical foundations of the modern theory and methods of nonlinear optimization and to analyze new problems, develop optimality theory for them, and choose or construct numerical solution methods.

With technological advances and market opening proceeding apace, and with globally oriented competitors taking aim at the last bastions of local dominance, globalization is at the top of the executive agenda of many companies that have historically considered their markets local or regional. Now, even start-ups and high-quality specialists, as well as formerly local monopolies like telecommunications companies and utilities, urgently need to develop a strategy for business without borders. Whereas previous research concentrated on articulating what global strategies look like in large multinational companies with decades of experience in operations abroad, The Leap to Globalization focuses on how globalizing is realized over time in companies that start from a narrow geographic base. Three characteristics differentiate globalizing as observed in current practice from simple international expansion. First, globalization implies a redefinition of customer value; second, globalizing is an entrepreneurial process that transforms the company; and third, speed plays an essential role in globalization.  Drawing on four years of field research covering twenty-two companies from sixteen industrial sectors, the authors -- both renowned experts in the field of strategic management -- provide a framework for managing the globalizing process. They show how companies can create new value from globalization by effectively marketing products, services, and competences anywhere, regardless of national borders. The analysis of both successful and unsuccessful cases reveals models of best practice in taking strategic action, building organizational competences, and adapting to changing risks. Concrete examples provide points of reference for achieving speed in globalizing without compromising sustainability.","Cultural geography Economic geography Sociocultural evolution Anti-globalization Globalization International trade","Economics","Mathematics"

Through a modern approach that utilizes fully calculated problems, the book addresses the importance of calculus and analysis in the applied sciences, with a focus on differential equations.Differing from the common classical approach to the topic, this book presents a modern perspective on calculus that follows motivations from Otto Toeplitz's famous genetic model. The result is an introduction that leads to great simplifications and provides a focused treatment commonly found in the applied sciences, particularly differential equations. The author begins with a short introduction to elementary mathematical logic. Next, the book explores the concept of sets and maps, providing readers with a strong foundation for understanding and solving modern mathematical problems. Ensuring a complete presentation, topics are uniformly presented in chapters that consist of three parts:    - Introductory Motivations presents historical mathematical problems or problems arising from applications that led to the development of mathematical solutions    - Theory provides rigorous development of the essential parts of the machinery of analysis; proofs are intentionally detailed, but simplified as much as possible to aid reader comprehension- Examples and Problems promotes problem-solving skills through application-based exercises that emphasize theoretical mechanics, general relativity, and quantum mechanics Calculus and Analysis: A Combined Approach is an excellent book for courses on calculus and mathematical analysis at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and anyone working in the applied sciences who would like to master their understanding of basic tools in modern calculus and analysis.","Functions and mappings Mathematical analysis Calculus Integral Vector calculus Derivative Mathematics Differential equation Generalizations of the derivative Outline of calculus Multiplicative calculus","Economics","Mathematics"

The authors see legitimacy anywhere as always partial, rather than total, and somewhat measurable. Legitimacy is specifically political, rather than more vaguely socioeconomic. It can be a predicate of various sizes of collectivity, not just of a sovereign government, or of policies, or of leaders. It can be challenged by patriotism. Legitimacy derives not just from scientific norms or technocracy, even in modern times. It is a belief whose alternative (illegitimacy) people may often suppress in their minds until external situations change, bringing an unexpected cascade of altered legitimacy.  The volume is edited by Lynn White, a professor in the Woodrow Wilson School and Politics Department at Princeton. It throws light not only on modern changes of the process of political legitimization, but also on the correlates of that process in specific East and Southeast Asian countries.","Authority Political culture Forms of government Legitimacy Sovereignty Authoritarianism Constitutionalism Legitimation crisis","Economics","Mathematics"

Richard Swedberg describes the field's critical insights into economic life, giving particular attention to the effects of culture on economic phenomena and the ways that economic actions are embedded in social structures. He examines the full range of economic institutions and explicates the relationship of the economy to politics, law, culture, and gender. Swedberg notes that sociologists too often fail to properly emphasize the role that self-interested behavior plays in economic decisions, while economists frequently underestimate the importance of social relations. Thus, he argues that the next major task for economic sociology is to develop a theoretical and empirical understanding of how interests and social relations work in combination to affect economic action.

This book addresses a wide range of contemporary issues in decision research, such as how individuals deal with uncertainty and complexity, gender-based differences in decision-making, what determines decision performance and why people choose risky activities.The book presents results from academic research carried out over the last twenty years. A common theme is the study of decisions made in horserace betting markets, a research medium which offers a rich insight into decision-making in general and one which enjoys particular methodological advantages over laboratory-based simulations. This set of naturalistic studies explores the variety of individual motivations for betting, how people perceive and respond to the presence of uncertainty, the challenges of complex and turbulent information and the use of heuristics as a response, how decision-making performance is affected by structural or process-related features of the decision environment, and how men and women differ in their decision behaviour.The authors’ interesting and novel findings offer a richer understanding of the psychological and economic underpinnings of betting behaviour which should inform practitioners, policymakers and regulators in an industry which is undergoing unprecedented global growth. The book is also relevant to courses covering subject areas such as financial markets, decision-making and behavioural finance.","Behavioral finance Microeconomics Critical thinking Decision theory Decision-making Neuropsychological assessment Risk Behavioral economics Gambling","Economics","Statistics"

When measured through linear correlation, many of these systems exhibit a slow correlation decay--a phenomenon often referred to as long-memory or long-range dependence. An example of this is the absolute returns of equity data in finance. Selfsimilar stochastic processes (particularly fractional Brownian motion) have long been postulated as a means to model this behavior, and the concept of selfsimilarity for a stochastic process is now proving to be extraordinarily useful. Selfsimilarity translates into the equality in distribution between the process under a linear time change and the same process properly scaled in space, a simple scaling property that yields a remarkably rich theory with far-flung applications.After a short historical overview, this book describes the current state of knowledge about selfsimilar processes and their applications. Concepts, definitions and basic properties are emphasized, giving the reader a road map of the realm of selfsimilarity that allows for further exploration. Such topics as noncentral limit theory, long-range dependence, and operator selfsimilarity are covered alongside statistical estimation, simulation, sample path properties, and stochastic differential equations driven by selfsimilar processes. Numerous references point the reader to current applications.Though the text uses the mathematical language of the theory of stochastic processes, researchers and end-users from such diverse fields as mathematics, physics, biology, telecommunications, finance, econometrics, and environmental science will find it an ideal entry point for studying the already extensive theory and applications of selfsimilarity.","Stochastic processes Fractional Brownian motion Long-range dependency Brownian motion Lévy process Stochastic Local time Wiener process Brownian bridge","Economics","Statistics"

But even the hardest of these problems can often be solved with a computer and a Monte Carlo simulation, in which a random-number generator simulates a physical process, such as a million rolls of a pair of dice. This is what Digital Dice is all about: how to get numerical answers to difficult probability problems without having to solve complicated mathematical equations.  	Popular-math writer Paul Nahin challenges readers to solve twenty-one difficult but fun problems, from determining the odds of coin-flipping games to figuring out the behavior of elevators. Problems build from relatively easy (deciding whether a dishwasher who breaks most of the dishes at a restaurant during a given week is clumsy or just the victim of randomness) to the very difficult (tackling branching processes of the kind that had to be solved by Manhattan Project mathematician Stanislaw Ulam). In his characteristic style, Nahin brings the problems to life with interesting and odd historical anecdotes. Readers learn, for example, not just how to determine the optimal stopping point in any selection process but that astronomer Johannes Kepler selected his second wife by interviewing eleven women.  	The book shows readers how to write elementary computer codes using any common programming language, and provides solutions and line-by-line walk-throughs of a MATLAB code for each problem.

In The Economics of Inaction, leading economist Nancy Stokey shows how the tools of stochastic control can be applied to dynamic problems of decision making under uncertainty when fixed costs are present. Stokey provides a self-contained, rigorous, and clear treatment of two types of models, impulse and instantaneous control. She presents the relevant results about Brownian motion and other diffusion processes, develops methods for analyzing each type of problem, and discusses applications to price setting, investment, and durable goods purchases.

Demographic trends in America, Europe, Russia, and Japan are reducing the pool of new workers. As the need for talent grows, China’s and India’s educational systems won’t be able to produce enough qualified graduates for themselves, let alone the rest of the world. But the heart of the problem is that the education-to-employment system worldwide is badly outmoded. We’re not producing graduates with the kinds of technical, communications, and thinking skills needed in the 21st century.  	In Winning the Global Talent Showdown, Ed Gordon surveys the sorry state of the world talent pipeline, with separate chapters on the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Each region faces its own challenges, yet the result is the same: a dramatic shortage of workers who can function in what Gordon calls our “cyber-mental” age.  	But this is fundamentally a book about solutions. Gordon argues that we need to completely reinvent our talent-creation system—and some pioneering efforts are already underway. He describes dozens of “gateways to the future,” innovative partnerships in which local governments, schools, businesses, labor unions, parents, training organizations, community activists, and others are collaborating to develop completely new approaches to education. Based on personal experience, Gordon outlines how concerned citizens can establish these partnerships in their own communities. And he looks down the road to 2020, explaining how we can build on the best of these new ideas so that the jobs pipeline flows freely again.","Talent Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics","Economics","Statistics"

It introduces first year Ph.D. students to standard graduate econometrics material from a modern perspective. It covers all the standard material necessary for understanding the principal techniques of econometrics from ordinary least squares through cointegration. The book is also distinctive in developing both time-series and cross-section analysis fully, giving the reader a unified framework for understanding and integrating results. Econometrics has many useful features and covers all the important topics in econometrics in a succinct manner. All the estimation techniques that could possibly be taught in a first-year graduate course, except maximum likelihood, are treated as special cases of GMM (generalized methods of moments). Maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of models (such as probit and tobit) are collected in a separate chapter. This arrangement enables students to learn various estimation techniques in an efficient manner. Eight of the ten chapters include a serious empirical application drawn from labor economics, industrial organization, domestic and international finance, and macroeconomics. These empirical exercises at the end of each chapter provide students a hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the chapter. The exposition is rigorous yet accessible to students who have a working knowledge of very basic linear algebra and probability theory. All the results are stated as propositions, so that students can see the points of the discussion and also the conditions under which those results hold. Most propositions are proved in the text. For those who intend to write a thesis on applied topics, the empirical applications of the book are a good way to learn how to conduct empirical research. For the theoretically inclined, the no-compromise treatment of the basic techniques is a good preparation for more advanced theory courses.","Econometrics Regression analysis Estimation theory Parametric statistics Time series analysis Linear regression Least squares Cointegration Ordinary least squares Heteroscedasticity Maximum likelihood David Forbes Hendry","Economics","Statistics"

But these models are useful only if they adequately account for the phenomena in question, and they can be quite misleading if they do not. In response, econometricians have developed tests and other checks for model adequacy. All of these methods, however, take as given the specification of the model to be tested. In this book, John Geweke addresses the critical earlier stage of model development, the point at which potential models are inherently incomplete.Summarizing and extending recent advances in Bayesian econometrics, Geweke shows how simple modern simulation methods can complement the creative process of model formulation. These methods, which are accessible to economics PhD students as well as to practicing applied econometricians, streamline the processes of model development and specification checking. Complete with illustrations from a wide variety of applications, this is an important contribution to econometrics that will interest economists and PhD students alike.","Econometrics Fellows of the Econometric Society Econometricians Bayesian econometrics Econometric model Economic model Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium Macroeconomic model Arnold Zellner David Forbes Hendry","Economics","Statistics"

Kuhn devotes considerable space to topics that, while not strictly the subject matter of game theory, are firmly bound to it. These are taken mainly from the geometry of convex sets and the theory of probability distributions.

Much has been published on the subject, but the technical nature of most papers makes them difficult for nonspecialists to understand, and the mathematical tools required for applications can be intimidating. Potential users often get the impression that jump and Lévy processes are beyond their reach.Financial Modelling with Jump Processes shows that this is not so. It provides a self-contained overview of the theoretical, numerical, and empirical aspects involved in using jump processes in financial modelling, and it does so in terms within the grasp of nonspecialists. The introduction of new mathematical tools is motivated by their use in the modelling process, and precise mathematical statements of results are accompanied by intuitive explanations.Topics covered in this book include: jump-diffusion models, Lévy processes, stochastic calculus for jump processes, pricing and hedging in incomplete markets, implied volatility smiles, time-inhomogeneous jump processes and stochastic volatility models with jumps. The authors illustrate the mathematical concepts with many numerical and empirical examples and provide the details of numerical implementation of pricing and calibration algorithms.This book demonstrates that the concepts and tools necessary for understanding and implementing models with jumps can be more intuitive that those involved in the Black Scholes and diffusion models. If you have even a basic familiarity with quantitative methods in finance, Financial Modelling with Jump Processes will give you a valuable new set of tools for modelling market fluctuations.","Mathematical finance Stochastic processes Options Jump process Quantitative analyst Jump diffusion Volatility Financial modeling Economic model Scientific modelling Finance Black–Scholes model","Economics","Statistics"

But probability and statistics  are becoming increasingly important in today’s society.  As the basic  ideas are being taught in elementary schools through college, it’s  important that everyone has a basic understanding of probability theory. Probability theory explains the happenings that occur due to chance.   Although it is not possible to predict for certain the individual  outcome of a chance process, it is possible to determine outcomes in the  “long run,” and to predict the probability that something will  eventually occur. This book will present the basics of probability in a non-rigorous  manner.  Only an understanding of arithmetic and some basic algebra are  necessary to learn these ideas.  No high-powered mathematical notation  or formal proofs will be used, rather the concepts will be developed  from examples using coins, dice, cards, and other common probability  devices.","Probability theory Probability Outcome Event Statistics Probability space Conditional probability","Economics","Statistics"

In doing so, the book sheds light on the hitherto under-researched contribution of French thinkers to econometrics. Fascinating and authoritative, it is a comprehensive overview of what went on to be one of the defining subsets within the economics profession.Le Gall explains how econometric ideas developed from, and were inspired by philosophical worldviews and scientific paradigms from the nineteenth century. Exploring the methodology of French authors like Cournot, Briaune and Regnault he demonstrates how they were influenced by the natural sciences of their time, rooted as they were in a worldview where natural order and laws played a central role and how, when an organized discipline emerged at the start of the Twentieth century, these econometric ideas intermingled with new worldviews associated with the complexity of the economy.This book is essential reading for postgraduate students and researchers in the history of economic thought, economic methodology and the history of science as well as econometricians at all levels.","Econometrics Fellows of the Econometric Society Econometricians Methodology of econometrics David Forbes Hendry","Economics","Statistics"

Changes in the new edition include:  Stronger focus on MCMC Revision of the computational advice in Part III New chapters on nonlinear models and decision analysis Several additional applied examples from the authors' recent research Additional chapters on current models for Bayesian data analysis such as nonlinear models, generalized linear mixed models, and more Reorganization of chapters 6 and 7 on model checking and data collection  Bayesian computation is currently at a stage where there are many reasonable ways to compute any given posterior distribution. However, the best approach is not always clear ahead of time. Reflecting this, the new edition offers a more pluralistic presentation, giving advice on performing computations from many perspectives while making clear the importance of being aware that there are different ways to implement any given iterative simulation computation.

Commonly referred to as """"market data"""", the universe of content is very wide and the type of information correspondingly diverse. Jargon and acronyms are very common. As a result, users of marker data typically face difficulty in applying the content in analysis and business applications. This guide provides an independent framework for understanding this diversity and streamlining the process of referring to content and how it relates to today's business environment. The book achieves this goal by providing a consistent frame of reference for users of market data. As such, it is built around the concept of a data model – a single, coherent view of the capital markets independent of any one source, such as an exchange. In particular it delineates clearly between the actual data content and how it is delivered (i.e., realtime data streams versus reference data). It shows how the data relates across the universe of securities (i.e., stocks, bonds, derivatives etc.). In this way it provides a logical framework for understanding how new content can be added over time as the business develops. Special features:   Uniqueness – this is the first comprehensive catalog and taxonomy to be made available for a business audience  Industry Acceptance – the framework described in this book is implemented as a relational data model in the industry today and used by blue chip multinational firms  Comprehensiveness – there are no arbitrary distinctions made based on asset class or data type (the legacy approach). The model presented in this book is fully cross asset and makes no distinction between data types (i.e., realtime versus historical/reference data) or sources  Independence – the framework is an independent, objective overview of how the data content integrates to provide a coherent view of the data produced by the global capital markets on a daily and intra-day basis.

Yvan Lengwiler elegantly links together issues that have in the past been the territory of general economic theorists on the one hand, and financial economists on the other.   In a sequence of carefully explained steps, the reader learns how the first welfare theorem is used in asset pricing theory. The book then moves on to explore Radner economies and von Neumann-Morgenstern decision theory, and this section culminates in Wilson's mutuality principle and the consumption-based CAPM. This is then put into a dynamic setting, and term structure models are introduced. The empirical shortcomings of the standard asset pricing models are extensively discussed, as is research from the last twenty years aimed at bringing theory in line with reality. The reader is brought up to date on the latest areas of concern, such as habit formation, the consequences of heterogeneity, demographic effects, changing tax regimes, market frictions, and the implications of prospect theory for asset pricing.  Aimed at masters or Ph.D. students specializing in financial economics, the book can also be used as a supplementary text for students of macroeconomics at this advanced level and will be of interest to finance professionals with a background in economics and mathematics.

In a sense, the economics of risk is a difficult subject: it involves understanding human decisions in the absence of perfect information. How do we make decisions when we do not know some of events affecting us? The complexities of our uncertain world and of how humans obtain and process information make this difficult.  In spite of these difficulties, much progress has been made. First, probability theory is the corner stone of risk assessment. This allows us to measure risk in a fashion that can be communicated among decision makers or researchers. Second, risk preferences are now better understood. This provides useful insights into the economic rationality of decision making under uncertainty. Third, over the last decades, good insights have been developed about the value of information. This helps better understand the role of information in human decision making and this book provides a systematic treatment of these issues in the context of both private and public decisions under uncertainty.","Actuarial science Decision theory Game theory Prospect theory Probability Risk Expected utility hypothesis Uncertainty Financial risk Risk management The Fat Tail: The Power of Political Knowledge for Strategic Investing","Economics","Statistics"

Setting aside the classical theory of probability measure spaces, the book utilizes a mathematically rigorous version of the theory of random variation that bases itself exclusively on finitely additive probability distribution functions.  		In place of twentieth century Lebesgue integration and measure theory, the author uses the simpler concept of Riemann sums, and the non-absolute Riemann-type integration of Henstock. Readers are supplied with an accessible approach to standard elements of probability theory such as the central limmit theorem and Brownian motion as well as remarkable, new results on Feynman diagrams and stochastic integrals.  		Throughout the book, detailed numerical demonstrations accompany the discussions of abstract mathematical theory, from the simplest elements of the subject to the most complex. In addition, an array of numerical examples and vivid illustrations showcase how the presented methods and applications can be undertaken at various levels of complexity.  A Modern Theory of Random Variation is a suitable book for courses on mathematical analysis, probability theory, and mathematical finance at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book is also an indispensible resource for researchers and practitioners who are seeking new concepts, techniques and methodologies in data analysis, numerical calculation, and financial asset valuation.

The author presents the theories of stochastic processes and stochastic calculus and provides the necessary tools for modeling and pricing in finance and insurance. Practical in focus, the book's emphasis is on application, intuition, and computation, rather than theory. Consequently, the text is of interest to graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in these areas. While the text is self-contained, an introductory course in probability theory is beneficial to prospective readers. This book evolved from the author's experience as an instructor and has been thoroughly classroom-tested. Following an introduction, the author sets forth the fundamental information and tools needed by researchers and practitioners working in the financial and insurance industries:   Overview of Probability Theory  Discrete-Time stochastic processes  Continuous-time stochastic processes  Stochastic calculus: basic topics   The final two chapters, Stochastic Calculus: Advanced Topics and Applications in Insurance, are devoted to more advanced topics. Readers learn the Feynman-Kac formula, the Girsanov's theorem, and complex barrier hitting times distributions. Finally, readers discover how stochastic analysis and principles are applied in practice through two insurance examples: valuation of equity-linked annuities under a stochastic interest rate environment and calculation of reserves for universal life insurance. Throughout the text, figures and tables are used to help simplify complex theory and pro-cesses. An extensive bibliography opens up additional avenues of research to specialized topics. Ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, this text is recommended for one-semester courses in stochastic finance and calculus.

Fabio Canova brings together dynamic equilibrium theory, data analysis, and advanced econometric and computational methods to provide the first comprehensive set of techniques for use by academic economists as well as professional macroeconomists in banking and finance, industry, and government. This graduate-level textbook is for readers knowledgeable in modern macroeconomic theory, econometrics, and computational programming using RATS, MATLAB, or Gauss. Inevitably a modern treatment of such a complex topic requires a quantitative perspective, a solid dynamic theory background, and the development of empirical and numerical methods--which is where Canova's book differs from typical graduate textbooks in macroeconomics and econometrics. Rather than list a series of estimators and their properties, Canova starts from a class of DSGE models, finds an approximate linear representation for the decision rules, and describes methods needed to estimate their parameters, examining their fit to the data. The book is complete with numerous examples and exercises.  	Today's economic analysts need a strong foundation in both theory and application. Methods for Applied Macroeconomic Research offers the essential tools for the next generation of macroeconomists.","Statistical inference Formal sciences New classical macroeconomics Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium Macroeconomic model Econometrics Bayesian Statistics Macroeconomics Estimation theory Time series Heterogeneity in economics","Economics","Statistics"

That’s a question every MBA faces. A lot of time and money has been invested in you, and once you graduate you’re supposed to cash that ticket in for as much money and status as you can. Your parents and peers expect it. And you may feel that there’s really no other choice. You can’t risk wasting that expensive education. It’s the safe thing to do. Isn’t it? Not necessarily. Mark Albion doesn’t pretend to have all the answers, but his unique perspective can help you find yours.  	There are other ways to look at potential risks and rewards, even when you have thousands of dollars of student loans to pay back. Money is important but it’s not the key to fulfillment. The “safe” choice, the most monetarily rewarding one, can carry enormous psychological and spiritual pain. As Ralph Waldo Emerson put it, “Sometimes money costs too much.”  	In More Than Money, Albion redefines the typical way the risk/reward equation is written, using his own life story and those of the many entrepreneurs, executives and MBAs he’s met as both cautionary and inspirational tales. He introduces a framework of four crucial questions to consider when thinking about your career choices, as well as “lifelines,"""" principles that can help you answer these questions and guide you to construct your personal, strategic destiny plan.  	A consciousness-raising book as well as a career guide, More Than Money encourages MBA students to give themselves permission to be who they really want to be and find their path of service. For, as Albion says, in the end “we won't remember you for the size of your wallet as much as the size of your heart.”""","Mark Albion","Economics","Econometrics"

Unfortunately, most yield curve models tend to be theoretically rigorous but empirically disappointing, or empirically successful but theoretically lacking. In this book, Francis Diebold and Glenn Rudebusch propose two extensions of the classic yield curve model of Nelson and Siegel that are both theoretically rigorous and empirically successful. The first extension is the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model (DNS), while the second takes this dynamic version and makes it arbitrage-free (AFNS). Diebold and Rudebusch show how these two models are just slightly different implementations of a single unified approach to dynamic yield curve modeling and forecasting. They emphasize both descriptive and efficient-markets aspects, they pay special attention to the links between the yield curve and macroeconomic fundamentals, and they show why DNS and AFNS are likely to remain of lasting appeal even as alternative arbitrage-free models are developed.

It is a family of different theories that were initially influential in economics, then lost much of their weight in the middle half of the 20th century, and eventually recovered significant creative vitality and impact in the last twenty years.

This activity took place in various environments; it always led to reflect on the content of macroeconomic knowledge, as well as on research methods for improving or applying knowledge; it called for continually reading the literature, often marvelling at new ideas or research innovations, sometimes also annoyed at misplaced claims or risky fashions, always wondering how recent results were progressively enriching or altering earlier accumulated knowledge.  Such a long maturation inevitably entails a perspective in which contributions made in the 1950s and 1960s find their place beside more modern ones, even when the latter may claim to encompass some of the former. But the book is not about the various macroeconomic schools, nor about the history of macroeconomic ideas. It rather aims at offering an organized treatment of present knowledge, occasionally exposing the contributions of famous authors or famous works, but only when that seemed to be unavoidable.  The book is addressed mainly to students who are already acquainted with economics and its methods. No prerequisite is absolutely required; but the text is too dense for being directly accessible to those who would be ignorant of economic concepts, of economic phenomena or of the economics discipline. The author hopes that the book will be used in the first years of post-graduate teaching. Also that it will serve as a reference on particular macroeconomic issues of unfamiliar approaches to varying economists.  Volumes A and B are simultaneously published, in advance of Volume C. These Volumes A and B already make a self-contained book, fully adequate for teaching a one-year course. Students will occasionally read references to short-run dynamics and to material contained in chapters 8 or 9; but knowing these references is never required for understanding the text where they occur.","New classical macroeconomics Economic theories New Keynesian economics Unemployment Macroeconomic policy Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium Macroeconomic model Macroeconomics Rational expectations Adaptive expectations Inflation Keynesian economics","Economics","Econometrics"

In the course of his investigation of Knight’s work, Emmett has written not only about Knight’s economics and philosophy, the nature of Chicago economics, and Knight’s place in the Chicago tradition, but also about the application of hermeneutic theory to the history of economics, the relation of the history of economic thought to the discipline of economics, and the relation between economics and religion.

It presents tactics for using mathematical and simulation models to solve complex tasks of forecasting income, valuing businesses, predicting retail sales, and evaluating markets and tax and regulatory problems.Business Economics and Finance with Matlab, GIS, and Simulation Models provides a unique overview of sophisticated business and financial applications. It describes models that have been developed for analysis of retail sales, tax policy, location, economic impact, public policy issues, and other challenges faced by executives, investors, and economists on a daily basis. It also offers groundbreaking insight into the many calculation and modeling tools that can be remotely hosted and run over the Internet, resulting in substantial user benefits and cost savings.This book is the first to fully explore the capabilities of MATLAB in the field of business economics, and explain how the benefits of sophisticated mathematical models can be provided to users via the Internet, using a thin-client environment. Many techniques directly incorporate geographic information and GIS in a way that was impossible until quite recently. Some techniques, such as fuzzy logic, retail sales, economic and fiscal impact models, and other Matlab and Simulink models, are described for the first time in print in this book. The sections on business income and value break new ground by directly incorporating uncertainty, real option value, and prediction of variables using Ito and jump processes. Using dozens of examples, hundreds of references, and rigorous explanations of both theory and practice, it will become a prized reference for analysts demanding the best techniques.","Cross-platform software Numerical software Simulation software Simulation Simulink MATLAB Economic model Economics Macroeconomic model Conceptual model Finance Financial modeling","Economics","Econometrics"

Happiness, they might say, is an ''unscientific'' concept. This is the first book to establish empirically the link between happiness and economics--and between happiness and democracy. Two respected economists, Bruno S. Frey and Alois Stutzer, integrate insights and findings from psychology, where attempts to measure quality of life are well-documented, as well as from sociology and political science. They demonstrate how micro- and macro-economic conditions in the form of income, unemployment, and inflation affect happiness. The research is centered on Switzerland, whose varying degrees of direct democracy from one canton to another, all within a single economy, allow for political effects to be isolated from economic effects. Not surprisingly, the authors confirm that unemployment and inflation nurture unhappiness. Their most striking revelation, however, is that the more developed the democratic institutions and the degree of local autonomy, the more satisfied people are with their lives. While such factors as rising income increase personal happiness only minimally, institutions that facilitate more individual involvement in politics (such as referendums) have a substantial effect. For countries such as the United States, where disillusionment with politics seems to be on the rise, such findings are especially significant. By applying econometrics to a real-world issue of general concern and yielding surprising results, Happiness and Economics promises to spark healthy debate over a wide range of the social sciences.","Happiness Positive mental attitude Happiness economics Bruno Frey Inflation Economics Richard Layard, Baron Layard","Economics","Econometrics"

Michael Wickens lays out the core ideas of modern macroeconomics and its links with finance. He presents the simplest general equilibrium macroeconomic model for a closed economy, and then gradually develops a comprehensive model of the open economy. Every important topic is covered, including growth, business cycles, fiscal policy, taxation and debt finance, current account sustainability, and exchange-rate determination. There is also an up-to-date account of monetary policy through inflation targeting. Wickens addresses the interrelationships between macroeconomics and modern finance and shows how they affect stock, bond, and foreign-exchange markets. In this edition, he also examines issues raised by the most recent financial crisis, and two new chapters explore banks, financial intermediation, and unconventional monetary policy, as well as modern theories of unemployment. There is new material in most other chapters, including macrofinance models and inflation targeting when there are supply shocks.

How then can pure """"fiat"""" currencies be managed so as to create confidence in the stability of national units of account? Interest and Prices seeks to provide theoretical foundations for a rule-based approach to monetary policy suitable for a world of instant communications and ever more efficient financial markets. In such a world, effective monetary policy requires that central banks construct a conscious and articulate account of what they are doing. Michael Woodford reexamines the foundations of monetary economics, and shows how interest-rate policy can be used to achieve an inflation target in the absence of either commodity backing or control of a monetary aggregate. The book further shows how the tools of modern macroeconomic theory can be used to design an optimal inflation-targeting regime--one that balances stabilization goals with the pursuit of price stability in a way that is grounded in an explicit welfare analysis, and that takes account of the """"New Classical"""" critique of traditional policy evaluation exercises. It thus argues that rule-based policymaking need not mean adherence to a rigid framework unrelated to stabilization objectives for the sake of credibility, while at the same time showing the advantages of rule-based over purely discretionary policymaking.""","Macroeconomic policy Public finance Monetary policy Central banks Fellows of the Econometric Society Monetary economics Inflation targeting Mathematical proof Inflation Michael Woodford Macroeconomics Proof","Economics","Econometrics"

So wrote Adam Smith a quarter of a millennium ago. Using the tools of modern political economics and combining economic theory with a bird's-eye view of the data, this book reinterprets Smith's pillars of prosperity to explain the existence of development clusters--places that tend to combine effective state institutions, the absence of political violence, and high per-capita incomes.  	To achieve peace, the authors stress the avoidance of repressive government and civil conflict. Easy taxes, they argue, refers not to low taxes, but a tax system with widespread compliance that collects taxes at a reasonable cost from a broad base, like income. And a tolerable administration of justice is about legal infrastructure that can support the enforcement of contracts and property rights in line with the rule of law. The authors show that countries tend to enjoy all three pillars of prosperity when they have evolved cohesive political institutions that promote common interests, guaranteeing the provision of public goods. In line with much historical research, international conflict has also been an important force behind effective states by fostering common interests. The absence of common interests and/or cohesive political institutions can explain the existence of very different development clusters in fragile states that are plagued by poverty, violence, and weak state capacity.""",NA,"Economics","Econometrics"

Most economists were deeply skeptical--even antagonistic--toward the idea of importing insights from psychology into their field. Today, behavioral economics has become virtually mainstream. It is well represented in prominent journals and top economics departments, and behavioral economists, including several contributors to this volume, have garnered some of the most prestigious awards in the profession. This book assembles the most important papers on behavioral economics published since around 1990. Among the 25 articles are many that update and extend earlier foundational contributions, as well as cutting-edge papers that break new theoretical and empirical ground. Advances in Behavioral Economics will serve as the definitive one-volume resource for those who want to familiarize themselves with the new field or keep up-to-date with the latest developments. It will not only be a core text for students, but will be consulted widely by professional economists, as well as psychologists and social scientists with an interest in how behavioral insights are being applied in economics.","Behavioral finance Prospect theory Decision theory Cognitive biases Consumer behaviour Behavioral economics Economics Loss aversion Inequity aversion Expected utility hypothesis Equity premium puzzle Economic model","Economics","Econometrics"

While the field of economics makes sharp distinctions and produces precise theory, the work of experimental economics sometimes appear blurred and may produce results that vary from strong support to little or partial support of the relevant theory. At a recent conference, a question was asked about where experimental methods might be more useful than field methods. Although many cannot be answered by experimental methods, there are questions that can only be answered by experiments. Much of the progress of experimental methods involves the posing of old or new questions in a way that experimental methods can be applied. The title of the book reflects the spirit of adventure that experimentalists share and focuses on experiments in general rather than forcing an organization into traditional categories that do not fit. The emphasis reflects the fact that the results do not necessarily demonstrate a consistent theme, but instead reflect bits and pieces of progress as opportunities to pose questions become recognized. This book is a result of an invitation sent from the editors to a broad range of experimenters asking them to write brief notes describing specific experimental results. The challenge was to produce pictures and tables that were self-contained so the reader could understand quickly the essential nature of the experiments and the results.","Experiments Auction theory Mathematical economics Experimental economics Economics Perfect competition Economic bubble Market Auction Walrasian auction Monopoly Experiment","Economics","Econometrics"

Using recent advances in evolutionary game theory, contract theory, behavioral experiments, and the modeling of dynamic processes, he develops a theory of how economic institutions shape individual behavior, and how institutions evolve due to individual actions, technological change, and chance events. Topics addressed include institutional innovation, social preferences, nonmarket social interactions, social capital, equilibrium unemployment, credit constraints, economic power, generalized increasing returns, disequilibrium outcomes, and path dependency.Each chapter is introduced by empirical puzzles or historical episodes illuminated by the modeling that follows, and the book closes with sets of problems to be solved by readers seeking to improve their mathematical modeling skills. Complementing standard mathematical analysis are agent-based computer simulations of complex evolving systems that are available online so that readers can experiment with the models.

If investors and accountants can concur on the degree of disclosure that is morally right we may come to some global agreement on what constitutes corruption — but to do this we have to bring together those who advocate profit-making with those who see this as usury; and we have to care for the future in novel ways — unknown in the past – so as to allow firms to be locally inefficient (apparently) while preserving the environment.  This book looks widely at the prevailing situation in Asia and considers how little some governments are doing to guide their institutions towards probity and transparency. While fundamental changes are needed around the globe, it is in the developing nations that there is scope for radical change in the near future, as their institutions are re-created to meet the modern world.

This book truly offers something new by emphasizing the general equilibrium character of macroeconomics to explain effects across the whole economy, not just part. It is also the perfect resource for economists who need to brush up on the latest developments.  Michael Wickens lays out the core ideas of modern macroeconomics and its links with finance. He presents the simplest general equilibrium macroeconomic model for a closed economy, and then gradually develops a comprehensive model of the open economy. Every important topic is covered, including growth, business cycles, fiscal policy, taxation and debt finance, current account sustainability, exchange-rate determination, and an up-to-date account of monetary policy through inflation targeting. Wickens addresses the interrelationships between macroeconomics and modern finance and shows how they affect stock, bond, and foreign-exchange markets. While the mathematics needed for this book is rigorous, the author describes fundamental concepts in a way that helps make the book self-contained and easy to use.

As a field, Public Economics is defined by its objectives rather than its techniques and much of what is new is the application of modern methods of economic theory and econometrics to problems that have been addressed by economists for over two hundred years. More generally, the discussion of public finance issues also involves elements of political science, finance and philosophy. These connections are evidence in several of the chapters that follow.  Public Economics is the positive and normative study of government's effect on the economy. We attempt to explain why government behaves as it does, how its behavior influences the behavior of private firms and households, and what the welfare effects of such changes in behavior are. Following Musgrave (1959) one may imagine three purposes for government intervention in the economy: allocation, when market failure causes the private outcome  to be Pareto inefficient, distribution, when the private market outcome leaves some individuals with unacceptably low shares  in the fruits of the economy, and stabilization, when the private market outcome leaves some of the economy's resources underutilized. The recent trend in economic research has tended to emphasize the character of stabilization problems as problems of allocation in the labor market. The effects that government intervention can have on the allocation and distribution of an economy's resources are described in terms of efficiency and incidence effects. These are the primary measures used to evaluate the welfare effects of government policy.","Public finance Economic theories Public economics Socioeconomics Tax Optimal tax Economics Economic model Finance Distribution Equity James Mirrlees","Economics","Econometrics"

This book fills a gap by providing advanced undergraduate and graduate students with the latest research and methodologies in an accessible and comprehensive way. It is an indispensable reference for researchers in economic geography, regional and urban economics, international trade, and applied econometrics, and can serve as a resource for economists in government.  Economic Geography presents advances in economic theory that explain why, despite the increasing mobility of commodities, ideas, and people, the diffusion of economic activity is very unequal and remains agglomerated in a limited number of spatial entities. The book complements theoretical analysis with detailed discussions of the empirics of the economics of agglomeration, offering a mix of theoretical and empirical research that gives a unique perspective on spatial disparities. It reveals how location continues to matter for trade and economic development, yet how economic integration is transforming the global economy into an economic space in which activities are performed within large metropolitan areas exchanging goods, skills, and information. Economic Geography examines the future implications of this evolution in the spatial economy and relates them to other major social and economic trends.

While economic globalization can be a boon for countries that are trying to dig out of poverty, success usually requires following policies that are tailored to local economic and political realities rather than obeying the dictates of the international globalization establishment. A definitive statement of Rodrik's original and influential perspective on economic growth and globalization, One Economics, Many Recipes shows how successful countries craft their own unique strategies--and what other countries can learn from them. To most proglobalizers, globalization is a source of economic salvation for developing nations, and to fully benefit from it nations must follow a universal set of rules designed by organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization and enforced by international investors and capital markets. But to most antiglobalizers, such global rules spell nothing but trouble, and the more poor nations shield themselves from them, the better off they are. Rodrik rejects the simplifications of both sides, showing that poor countries get rich not by copying what Washington technocrats preach or what others have done, but by overcoming their own highly specific constraints. And, far from conflicting with economic science, this is exactly what good economics teaches.","World government Cultural geography Economic geography International trade Dani Rodrik Economic globalization Globalization Development economics Global governance Outline of globalization Concertina model","Economics","Econometrics"

Why did the Industrial Revolution--and the unprecedented economic growth that came with it--occur in eighteenth-century England, and not at some other time, or in some other place? Why didn't industrialization make the whole world rich--and why did it make large parts of the world even poorer? In A Farewell to Alms, Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a new and provocative way in which culture--not exploitation, geography, or resources--explains the wealth, and the poverty, of nations.  Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable political, legal, and economic institutions in seventeenth-century Europe, Clark shows that such institutions existed long before industrialization. He argues instead that these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by encouraging people to abandon hunter-gatherer instincts-violence, impatience, and economy of effort-and adopt economic habits-hard work, rationality, and education.  The problem, Clark says, is that only societies that have long histories of settlement and security seem to develop the cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable economic growth. For the many societies that have not enjoyed long periods of stability, industrialization has not been a blessing. Clark also dissects the notion, championed by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, that natural endowments such as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations.  A brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies can be economically developed through outside intervention, A Farewell to Alms may change the way global economic history is understood.","Demographic economics Demography Human geography Economic indicators Economic theories Malthusian trap Economic growth Demographic transition Great Divergence Economic inequality Malthusianism Poverty","Economics","Econometrics"

In this volume, some of the world's leading thinkers in behavioral economics and general economic theory make the case for a much greater use of behavioral ideas in six fields where these ideas have already proved useful but have not yet been fully incorporated--public economics, development, law and economics, health, wage determination, and organizational economics.

In this way Mises explained how complex market phenomena develop. Mises did not simply describe economic phenomena - prices, wages, interest rates, money, monopoly and even the trade cycle - he explained them as the outcomes of countless conscious, purposive actions, choices, and preferences of individuals, each of whom was trying as best as he or she could under the circumstances to attain various wants and ends and to avoid undesired consequences.

An original treatment of the subject rather than a textbook synthesis, the book contains new analysis that generates novel results, including some that overturn long-standing conventional wisdom. This fresh approach should change thinking, research, and teaching for decades to come.  	Building on the work of James Mirrlees, Anthony Atkinson and Joseph Stiglitz, and subsequent researchers, and in the spirit of classics by A. C. Pigou, William Vickrey, and Richard Musgrave, this book steps back from particular lines of inquiry to consider the field as a whole, including the relationships among different fiscal instruments. Louis Kaplow puts forward a framework that makes it possible to rigorously examine both distributive and distortionary effects of particular policies despite their complex interactions with others. To do so, various reforms--ranging from commodity or estate and gift taxation to regulation and public goods provision--are combined with a distributively offsetting adjustment to the income tax. The resulting distribution-neutral reform package holds much constant while leaving in play the distinctive effects of the policy instrument under consideration. By applying this common methodology to disparate subjects, The Theory of Taxation and Public Economics produces significant cross-fertilization and yields solutions to previously intractable problems.",NA,"Economics","Econometrics"

John T. Harvey combines analyses rooted in the scholarly traditions of John Maynard Keynes and Thorstein Veblen with that of modern psychology to produce a set of new theories to explain international monetary economics, including not only exchange rates but also world financial crises.In the book, the traditional approach is reviewed and critiqued and the alternative is then built by studying the psychology of the market and balance of payments questions. The central model has at its core Keynes’ analysis of the macroeconomy and it assumes neither full employment nor balanced trade over the short or long run. Market participants’ mental model, which they use to forecast future exchange rate movements, is specified and integrated into the explanation. A separate but related discussion of currency crises shows that three distinct tension points emerge in booming economies, any one of which can break and signal the collapse. Each of the models is compared to post-Bretton Woods history and the reader is shown exactly how various shifts and adjustments on the graphs can explain the dollar’s ups and downs and the Mexican (1994) and Asian (1997) crises.","Economic indicators International trade Economic theories International finance National accounts Foreign exchange market Balance of payments Currency crisis Financial crisis John Maynard Keynes Keynesian economics Economics","Economics","Econometrics"

A lively and entertaining tour of the most exciting new economic thinking about big-picture problems, The Soulful Science uncovers the hidden humanization of economics over the past two decades.  	Coyle shows how better data, increased computing power, and techniques such as game theory have transformed economic theory and practice in recent years, enabling economists to make huge strides in understanding real human behavior. Using insights from psychology, evolution, and complexity, economists are revolutionizing efforts to solve the world's most serious problems by giving policymakers a new and vastly more accurate picture of human society than ever before. They are also building our capacity to understand how what we do today shapes what the world will look like tomorrow. And the consequences of these developments for human life, for governments, and for businesses are only now starting to be realized--in areas such as resource auctions, pollution-credit trading, and monetary policy.

It was a book by Baumol and Bowen which showed that economic analysis could illuminate the supply of and demand for artistic services, the contribution of the arts sector to the economy, and the role of public policy. Following the appearance of the Baumol and Bowen work, interest in the economics of the arts grew steadily, embracing areas such as demand for the arts, the economic functions of artists, the role of the nonprofit sector, and other areas. Cultural economics also expanded to include the cultural or entertainment industries (the media, movies, the publishing industry, popular music), as well as heritage and museum management, property right questions (in particular copyright) and the role of new communication technologies such as the internet. The field is therefore located at the crossroads of several disciplines: economics and management, but also art history, art philosophy, sociology and law.

Here, North explains how different societies arrive at the institutional infrastructure that greatly determines their economic trajectories.  North argues that economic change depends largely on """"adaptive efficiency,"""" a society's effectiveness in creating institutions that are productive, stable, fair, and broadly accepted--and, importantly, flexible enough to be changed or replaced in response to political and economic feedback. While adhering to his earlier definition of institutions as the formal and informal rules that constrain human economic behavior, he extends his analysis to explore the deeper determinants of how these rules evolve and how economies change. Drawing on recent work by psychologists, he identifies intentionality as the crucial variable and proceeds to demonstrate how intentionality emerges as the product of social learning and how it then shapes the economy's institutional foundations and thus its capacity to adapt to changing circumstances.  Understanding the Process of Economic Change accounts not only for past institutional change but also for the diverse performance of present-day economies. This major work is therefore also an essential guide to improving the performance of developing countries.""","Guggenheim Fellows Intention Douglass North Economics Intentionality Market Institutional economics Productivity","Economics","Econometrics"

Although Adam Smith amply confirmed this more than two hundred years ago in his analysis of sharecropping contracts, only in recent decades has a theory begun to emerge to place the topic at the heart of economic thinking. In this book, Jean-Jacques Laffont and David Martimort present the most thorough yet accessible introduction to incentives theory to date. Central to this theory is a simple question as pivotal to modern-day management as it is to economics research: What makes people act in a particular way in an economic or business situation? In seeking an answer, the authors provide the methodological tools to design institutions that can ensure good incentives for economic agents. This book focuses on the principal-agent model, the """"simple"""" situation where a principal, or company, delegates a task to a single agent through a contract--the essence of management and contract theory. How does the owner or manager of a firm align the objectives of its various members to maximize profits? Following a brief historical overview showing how the problem of incentives has come to the fore in the past two centuries, the authors devote the bulk of their work to exploring principal-agent models and various extensions thereof in light of three types of information problems: adverse selection, moral hazard, and non-verifiability. Offering an unprecedented look at a subject vital to industrial organization, labor economics, and behavioral economics, this book is set to become the definitive resource for students, researchers, and others who might find themselves pondering what contracts, and the incentives they embody, are really all about.""","Asymmetric information Market failure Economic theories Game theory Law and economics Contract theory Moral hazard Mechanism design Adverse selection Information asymmetry Economics Incentive","Economics","Econometrics"

This book provides a new, comprehensive, and in-depth examination of the standard theories and latest research in exchange-rate economics. Covering a vast swath of theoretical and empirical work, the book explores established theories of exchange-rate determination using macroeconomic fundamentals, and presents unique microbased approaches that combine the insights of microstructure models with the macroeconomic forces driving currency trading.  	Macroeconomic models have long assumed that agents--households, firms, financial institutions, and central banks--all have the same information about the structure of the economy and therefore hold the same expectations and uncertainties regarding foreign currency returns. Microbased models, however, look at how heterogeneous information influences the trading decisions of agents and becomes embedded in exchange rates. Replicating key features of actual currency markets, these microbased models generate a rich array of empirical predictions concerning trading patterns and exchange-rate dynamics that are strongly supported by data. The models also show how changing macroeconomic conditions exert an influence on short-term exchange-rate dynamics via their impact on currency trading.  	Designed for graduate courses in international macroeconomics, international finance, and finance, and as a go-to reference for researchers in international economics, Exchange-Rate Dynamics guides readers through a range of literature on exchange-rate determination, offering fresh insights for further reading and research.

But bombarded by fads and fixes, most managers have been groping blindly to get their arms around the proverbial elephant. Now Henry Mintzberg, author of the award-winning The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning, has teamed up with Bruce Ahlstrand and Joseph Lampel to create a powerful antidote: a comprehensive and illuminating -- as well as colorful -- tour through the fields of strategic management. Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, and Lampel have shaped each of ten different approaches into a coherent school of strategy formation. In the process, the authors clarify the enormous amount of confusion that exists.  	The result is a tour de force: a brilliant, penetrating primer on business strategy that is, at the same time, immensely readable and fun. The authors provide a thorough critique of the contributions and limitations of each school -- from the design, planning, positioning, entrepreneurial, and cognitive schools to the learning, power, cultural, environmental, and configurational schools -- culminating in how they might combine to reveal that elephant.

Since that time, it has been a best-practice example for managing a successful knowledge management initiative. The World Bank has developed new ideas and tangible results through its focus and allocation of resources. It is an excellent model of consistently effective principals APQC has found among leading learning organizations.

Unlike a report that simply indicates an organization's current perspective, this series details research from the early days of improvement efforts through the organization's mature outlook as it experiences successes.  The information in this report is from six consortium benchmarking studies conducted over seven years, as well as presentations by the World Bank at APQC conferences. The World Bank Profile details the World Bank's formalization of knowledge management efforts, implementation, communities of practice, partnerships, leadership, training, technology, and measurement.  Also included are project examples, success stories, and critical lessons learned.

The Difference is about how we think in groups--and how our collective wisdom exceeds the sum of its parts. Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? And why are the best group decisions and predictions those that draw upon the very qualities that make each of us unique? The answers lie in diversity--not what we look like outside, but what we look like within, our distinct tools and abilities.The Difference reveals that progress and innovation may depend less on lone thinkers with enormous IQs than on diverse people working together and capitalizing on their individuality. Page shows how groups that display a range of perspectives outperform groups of like-minded experts. Diversity yields superior outcomes, and Page proves it using his own cutting-edge research.

This book redresses this balance by providing an original analysis of change management in organizations in the light of wider sociological perspectives. It critically examines the, often implicit, theoretical frameworks underpinning many contemporary accounts of organizational change, and covers subjects including:  the importance of explicit analysis of theory and context a critique of populist management gurus and quick-fix 'how-to' solutions 'under-socialized' models of change which emphasise structure over human action trenchant analysis of 'soft' HRM solutions the management of culture.

In this groundbreaking book, visionary business authors Stan Davis and David McIntosh argue that not only is this possible, but that applying an artistic sensibility to business will actually improve business performance.  	Traditionally, business focuses only on the economic flow of inputs (resources, raw materials), outputs (products and services) and processes that help get you from one to the other (research and development, production, distribution). Davis and McIntosh show that there's an artistic flow that operates the same way, but with different particulars. Inputs here include things like emotion, imagination and intuition; and outputs include things like beauty, meaning, excitement and enjoyment. To bridge these aesthetic inputs and outputs, the authors show how to apply creative processes from the arts to business, and how to connect with customers the way great performers connect with audiences.  	Through real-world examples and practical advice, The Art of Business shows how applying this concept of artistic flow enables you to come up with more creative solutions to problems, develop better new products, and provide your customers with the kinds of emotionally and aesthetically satisfying experiences they've come to expect in this high contact, mulimedia age. It gives you an additional--rather than alternative--approach to the established economic model of how things get done.

While MNEs are important, such a focus ignores the fact (1) that many smaller, entrepreneurial firms have also aggressively internationalized recently and (2) that MNEs often have to compete in emerging economies, which increasingly nurture strong local competitors. Most “mainstream” strategic management textbooks, while seeming to address the hot theme of globalization, contain only one chapter on “international strategy.” Finally, most international business textbooks do have a section (containing several chapters) on international strategy. However, they always carry a wider coverage of major business functions such as marketing, operations, finance, and accounting, making them unwieldy.  Global Strategy is written to offer a number of new perspectives. These include (1) a broadened definition of “global strategy,” (2) a comprehensive and innovative coverage, (3) an in-depth and consistent explanation of cutting-edge research, and (4) an interesting and accessible way to engage students. In this book, “global strategy” is defined not as MNE strategy only, but as “strategy around the globe.” Most global strategy and international business textbooks take the perspective of the foreign entrant, typically the MNE, often dealing with issues such as how to enter foreign markets. Important as these issues are, they only cover one side of international business, namely, the foreign side. The other side, naturally, is how domestic firms compete against each other and against foreign entrants. Failing to understand the “other side,” at best, captures only one side of the coin.","International trade Management Strategy Global strategy Strategic management Competitiveness International business Springboard Theory","Management","Corporate management"

It goes without saying that Information technology has had a major impact on individuals, organizations and society over the past 50 years or so. There are few organizations that can afford to ignore IT and few individuals who would prefer to be without it. As managerial tasks become more complex, so the nature of the required information systems (IS) changes - from structured, routine support to ad hoc, unstructured, complex enquiries at the highest levels of management.  As with the first and second editions, this third edition of Strategic Information Management: Challenges and strategies in managing information systems aims to present the many complex and inter-related issues associated with the management of information systems. The book provides a rich source of material reflecting recent thinking on the key issues facing executives in information systems management.

Kaplan and David P. Norton, the concept of the Balanced Scorecard has achieved increasing popularity in the business world. Previously, many organizations had built their business objectives around financial targets and goals that bore little relation to a long-term strategic vision. Typically, this leaves a gap between the development of a company's strategy and its implementation.  The business scorecard, however, provides a more 'balanced view' by looking at not just-financial concerns, but also customers, internal business processes, and learning and growth. But it is not just a system of performance measurement - by focusing on future potential success it can be used as a dynamic management system that reinforces, implements and drives corporate strategy forward. In this book, the authors draw on their extensive experience with scorecard projects to provide a step-by-step method for introducing the Balanced Scorecard into an organization. This is done through the use of some of the most important practical examples in existence, with case studies from ABB, Coca Cola, Electrolux, British Telecom, Nat West, Skandia and Volvo.  The desired strategic control system using scorecards that is presented focuses on creating and communicating a total comprehensive picture to all members of the organization from the top down, a long-term view of what the company's strategic objectives really are, how to make use of knowledge gained through experience and the required flexibility of such a system to cope with the fast-changing business environment.  This book will provide senior and operational managers, consultants and business academics with a comprehensive view of emerging Balanced Scorecard practice supported by both business advice and a theoretical foundation. Reflections on the relations between the Balanced Scorecard and other areas, such as TQM, information systems and intellectual capital and knowledge management are also made.","Management Strategic management Balanced scorecard Business software Performance measurement Strategy implementation Scorecard Third-generation balanced scorecard Strategy map","Management","Corporate management"

Rejecting the one-size-fits-all premise that underlies so many guides to business strategy, Preston McAfee develops the intellectual tools and insights needed to confront many marketplace problems. Drawing on his broad experience as a consultant for major U.S. companies, as well as extensive research, McAfee emphasizes cooperation, pricing, litigation, and antitrust as vital to a firm's competitive posture--and focuses more attention on these elements than do most business strategy accounts.McAfee begins by considering strategy as successfully applied by America OnLine, an example that introduces many of the tools discussed in greater depth throughout the book. From here he moves to industry analysis: By examining the context for developing a strategy, he points out uses of positioning and differentiation that enable a firm to weaken price competition and deter rivals from stealing customers. McAfee's exploration of a product's life cycle proves an invaluable guide to positioning new technology in order to maximize the potential for future customers.In the centerpiece of the book, McAfee lays out a how-to manual for cooperation, providing tactics crucial for setting standards, lobbying the government, and fostering industry growth. Writing in a conversational manner, McAfee also addresses such deep topics as organizational design and employee compensation and incentives. More detailed discussions examine antitrust enforcement, which is an increasingly important constraint on strategy, as well as strategies for pricing, bidding, signaling, and bargaining.This book is a fascinating examination of modern business strategy and its application in many different settings. Students of business and economics--as well as executives and managers--will recognize Competitive Solutions as an indispensable resource as well as a definitive vision of the strategic firm: one in which each element of company strategy reinforces the other elements.","Management Marketing Strategic management Competition Imperfect competition Preston McAfee Porter's five forces analysis Pricing Barriers to entry Competitive advantage Price discrimination","Management","Corporate management"

Innovation is not simply developing new technologies into new products or services, but in many cases finding new models for doing business in the face of change. It often entails changing the rules of the game.From the late 1990s to today, the dominant themes in the strategy literature have been strategic innovation, the impact of information and communications technologies on commerce, and globalization. The primary issues have been and continue to be how to gain a competitive advantage through strategic innovation (what Afuah calls """"new game strategy""""), and how to compete in a world with rapid technological change and increasing globalization. Strategic Innovation demonstrates to students how to create and appropriate value using these """"new game"""" strategies. Beginning with a summary of the major strategic frameworks showing the origins of strategic innovation, Afuah gives a thorough examination of contemporary strategy from an innovation standpoint with several key advantages:  Focus on developing strategy in the face of change Rich in quantitative examples of successful strategies, as well as descriptive cases Emphasis on the analysis of strategy, not just descriptions of strategies A detailed, change-inclusive framework for assessing the profitability potential of a strategy or product, the AVAC (activities, value, appropriability, and change) model Emphasis on the aspects of strategy that can be linked to the determinants of profitability Consideration of how both for-profit and non-profit organizations can benefit from new game strategies""","Game theory Coopetition Innovation Strategy Strategic management Blue Ocean Strategy","Management","Corporate management"

Rapid changes in technology, a more diverse workforce, changes in government regulations, worldwide competition, and the growing complexity of things in general have increased our awareness of the need for more effective leaders. Developing leaders requires having an understanding of the knowledge and skills required for effective leaders. Leadership Skills for Managers, 4th edition, focuses on five leadership skill sets necessary to ensure individual and organization performance: providing direction, leading by example, enabling others, sharing power, and seeking a better way. In addition to the leadership skill sets, the book examines the attitudes and mindsets of effective leaders. In the final analysis, the evidence of leadership is in the performance of the people and the organizations that follow the leader. When they perform well, the leader is a success. When they don’t perform well, leadership changes are almost always forthcoming. This book provides the background, real-world examples, practical applications, and numerous exercises to help prepare aspiring leaders. The lessons learned in this course can be applied to any leadership level in an organization and in any type of organization. Readers will learn how to: * Make the change from manager to leader. * Provide direction. * Enable others to achieve and succeed. * Develop a vision and create alignment. * Grow and develop new leaders. * Appraise leadership performance. * Use Continuous Improvement.

The Purchasing department must prove that it can have a positive impact on product quality and innovation, and also EBIT or working capital, and that it is contributing to decision-making regarding the company's strategic investments.   The argument put forward in this work is clear: the Purchasing Function is no longer a """"support function"""" that simply carries out purchase requests. It is now a """"Business & Financial Partner"""" of Executive Management, and it must substantially contribute to crafting and implementing strategy, and to financial steering, risk management, and value creation.   It must be part in the company's key decisions, which mainly rely on financial criteria, and work across all functions with the other Functional and Operational divisions.   The Purchasing Function should serve as an active contributor to the company's competitiveness, on equal footing with the other functions.

With data culled from the authors’ 20-plus-year longitudinal study of how general managers view HR’s focus and performance, Human Resource Transformation presents a system perspective for total talent management and business success, examining the key elements of culture, business environment, strategy, talent need, competencies and capabilities, capacity, and human capital and innovation. With a wealth of fresh research and dozens of in-depth case studies— from AT&T to IBM to the U.S. Navy—the authors illustrate how to move HR from the end of the business process chain to its rightful position as the strategic leader in aligning talent with organizational goals to help shape corporate strategy and competitive advantage.","Human resource management Talent management Strategic leadership Outsourcing","Management","Corporate management"

The focus is on Britain after a decade of public policy which has once again altered the terrain on which employment relations develop. Government has attempted to balance flexibility with fairness, preserving light-touch regulation whilst introducing rights to minimum wages and to employee representation in the workplace. Yet this is an open economy, conditioned significantly by developing patterns of international trade and by European Union policy initiatives. This interaction of domestic and cross-national influences in analysis of changes in employment relations runs throughout the volume.  	The structure has been amended slightly. Britain is placed straight away in comparative perspective before attention focuses explicitly on employment relations actors, contexts, processes, and outcomes. Each of the chapters is written by authorities in the field and provides up to date analysis and commentary. A spine of chapters from the preceding volume have been revised and extensively updated and new chapters have been added to refine coverage of issues such as the private sector and developing legal institutions.  	Overall, a picture emerges of an economy that is in incremental and contested transition. The imperatives of 'globalization' now infuse governance mechanisms that were once responsive principally to domestic agenda and employment standards are set now by the state that once were established through collective bargaining. It is this fragile and emerging model that will be tested significantly through sustained political and economic change.  	""""Completely revised, the latest edition of Industrial Relations provides an invaluable guide to the actors, contexts, processes and significant outcomes within British employment relations. Based on a thorough review of the latest research, it is essential reading for students, academics and those professionally involved in employment relations and human resource management."""" 	—Edmund Heery, Cardiff Business School  	""""This is a terrific collection of insightful analyses of British workplace relations in a global context provided by leading scholars. The chapters creatively utilize a multidisciplinary and critical approach that reveals the continuing and unique value of an industrial relations perspective. The volume cleverly assesses how factors including increased demographic diversity, organizational restructuring, globalization, and the reduced coverage of collective bargaining are affecting the nature and evolution of work and workplace relations. It is a must read. 	—Harry C. Katz, Cornell University, New York  	""""This volume definitely constitutes the most comprehensive and best collection of empirical as well as analytical essays on industrial relations in Great Britain.

Coming to grips with the complexity and fluidity of organization and management is a persistent problem for scholars and practitioners alike, which is why process issues have received renewed interest in recent years. This book, aimed at scholars and higher level students, frames some of these issues in novel and instructive ways.Process views have existed since before the early Greek philosophers and have made decisive marks in all sciences. Alfred North Whitehead’s classic work is a landmark in process philosophy, and his thinking provides renewed impetus to social scientists in search of an expanded framework of process thinking. Theorists such as Niklas Luhmann, Bruno Latour, Karl Weick and James March have contributed significantly towards a process view of organization. In this book, central aspects of their thinking are interpreted and discussed with the help of a broader canvas of process thinking provided by Whitehead. The comparisons do not only allow for interesting connections to be made between the theorists, but they also enable understanding to be made of the thinking behind their respective works. From the analysis, ideas are suggested for a framework for process-based organizational analysis.Advanced students and academics in sociology, organization studies and management studies will find this book useful in its discussion of such subjects as organization theory, process philosophy and process studies.","Information science Organizational studies Self-organization Systems theory Karl E.

March uses literature to examine a set of dilemmas related to leadership - questions concerning the balance between private life and public duties, between ingenuity and innocence, between diversity and integration, and between the expression and the control of sexuality.

All too often, to our bewilderment, our sincere offers of help are resented, resisted, or refused—and we often react the same way when people try to help us. Why is it so difficult to provide or accept help? How can we make the whole process easier?Many different words are used for helping: assisting, aiding, advising, caregiving, coaching, consulting, counseling, guiding, mentoring, supporting, teaching, and many more. In this seminal book on the topic, corporate culture and organizational development guru Ed Schein analyzes the social and psychological dynamics common to all types of helping relationships, explains why help is often not helpful, and shows what any would-be helpers must do to ensure that their assistance is both welcomed and genuinely useful.The moment of asking for and offering help is a delicate and complex one, fraught with inequities and ambiguities. Schein helps us navigate that moment so we avoid potential pitfalls, mitigate power imbalances, and establish a solid foundation of trust. He identifies three roles a helper can play, explaining which one is nearly always the best starting point if we are to provide truly effective help. So that readers can determine exactly what kind of help is needed, he describes an inquiry process that puts the helper and the client on an equal footing, encouraging the client to open up and engage and giving the helper much better information to work with. And he shows how these techniques can be applied to teamwork and to organizational leadership.Illustrated with examples from many types of relationships—husbands and wives, doctors and patients, consultants and clients—Helping is a concise, definitive analysis of what it takes to establish successful, mutually satisfying helping relationships.","Human resource management Evolutionary biology Helping behavior Social psychology Coaching Organizational culture","Management","Social Management"

An integral part of this process has been the rise of 'organizational cultures' unique to particular firms. In a world where such cultures are often in conflict with the societies in which they operate how can we understand the workings of cultural patterns and the kinds of transformations they can create?This concise new introductory text provides succint analysis of organizational cultures and types of change they can set in motion. 'culture' is used in an original way to bring together and make sense of cenrtral issues of organizational behaviour. The author explores the way in which forms of culture can influence styles of management, attitudes toward leadership, the level of motivation in the workplace and `hidden agendas' in group dynamics. Organizational Cultures raises the important issue of whether their can be such a thing as a `right decision' for an organization, and brings into focus the major implications and dangers of the growing numbers of supra-national firms both in terms of internal structure and for the context which they function. Throughout, the author succeeds in weaving together behaviour and organization, thus reconciling the traditional divorce between psychology and sociology in the field. Drawing on case studies from Europe, Asia, Africa, Organizational Cultures provides a truly international insight into forms of organizational behaviour. Detailed chapter objectives and summaries are provided to aid progress and self-assessment.","Industrial and organizational psychology Human resource management Social psychology Organizational theory Labour law Organizational culture Organizational behavior Organization development Leadership Motivation Organizational identification","Management","Social Management"

A pervasive part of the Chinese business world for the last few centuries, it binds literally millions of Chinese firms into a social and business web.

In China’s new, fast-paced business environment, guanxi has been more entrenched than ever, heavily influencing Chinese social behavior and business practice. However, as in other emerging economies, corruption in China is becoming more rampant, which makes guanxi and corruption often intermingled. As such, business executives need to place greater caution today in the practice and process of guanxi development and utilization.

Traditionally, strategy and organization development and change have occupied different worlds; one grounded in the economic and management sciences, the other in the applied behavioural sciences. In this enlightening text, Coghlan and Rashford abridge these two worlds using a framework of organizational levels.In this important text, the authors here clearly demonstrate how such processes are brought together in an interlevel approach. They focus on the involvement of such players as:  individuals (CEO, senior managers and others) teams (senior management team, board, other teams) inter-departmental groups (inter-team) the organization (in its external relations).  This interdepartmental aspect of most organizations is critical to developing and deploying strategic actions, yet is often never discussed.Exploring both the external and internal discontinuous nature of forces for change, this book guides the reader through the intricacies of this highly complex subject. Expertly combining theory with practice, it will be a valuable book for masters level and advanced undergraduate students, and for all those concerned with strategy and change.","Organizational theory Change management Organization development","Management","Social Management"

More than public relations posturing or kowtowing to political correctness, social responsibility in corporations is proving essential to the long-term success of companies in today's globalized economy. Businesses must now contend with a globalized public that is increasingly aware of business' obligations to society and expects a level of accountability that most companies cannot meet. Good companies must go beyond merely being good-they must have integrity and a strategy aligned with it.  Integrity in business has traditionally meant being honest, upright, and ethical, but in response to globalization, companies are being forced to move beyond this definition and add to it another fundamental quality-integration with society. Corporations must anticipate and respond directly to the demands of public opinion rather than waiting for government intervention, mediation, and regulation to force them into action. When Good Companies Do Bad Things explores the strategic relationship between know-how, integrity, and integration, demonstrating how companies that fail to embrace the deeper meanings of these terms jeopardize their reputations and future prosperity.  The notion of corporations taking on social issues for the greater good is gaining momentum, not only because of political correctness but because it can strengthen a company's long-term strategy. Peter Schwartz and Blair Gibb examine well-known cases of companies like Shell, Nike, Texaco, and Nestlé, illustrating the huge financial risks of corporate assumptions that lead many companies to make poor choices.

However, the focus has been on material forms of culture such as arts, music, or crafts. The impacts of national culture on tourist behavior and travel decision-making have not been paid much attention. Only in the last two years have cross-cultural issues begun to generate significant interest among academics. An examination of cultural characteristics and differences is extremely important to the tourism industry because today's tourism environment is becoming increasingly international. Advances in technology, and improved communication and transportation have enhanced peoples' mobility and travel such that exposure to culturally different societies, cultures exchanges and interactions is now commonplace. It is imperative for industry representatives, who operate in the international business environment and deal with foreign tourists on a daily basis, to understand the influence of national cultures of their customers. Unfortunately, information on the nature of the cultural differences between international tourists and locals is not readily available in tourism literature. The concept of culture is very complex. The analysis of cultural differences in a multidisciplinary tourism context and/or application of the literature on cultural differences in the abstract concepts such as satisfaction, attitude or loyalty (that have different meanings in different cultures) to the tourism context create problems. Although the effects of national characteristics on consumer behavior in general have been investigated in several research studies, more information is required concerning the cultural differences in the tourism context. This book will bring these concepts to the undergraduate student in tourism, as well as students in the related fields of marketing, management, international business, and cross-cultural communication.

Bringing together real-world examples—from Harley-Davidson to Nestlé, Rudy Giuliani to Shackleton's Antarctic expedition—Campbell and Samiec explore the five key leadership dimensions employed by the most successful leaders today: commanding, visioning, enrolling, relating, and coaching. With profiles of seven common business challenges—rapid growth to sudden crises—they detail when and how to use each dimension and the concrete actions required to achieve specific strategic objectives. 5-D Leadership offers a wealth of self-assessment and planning tools to help current and aspiring leaders discover their dominant leadership dimension, identify and leverage their strengths, and apply their skills and talents to lead effectively in whatever situation they face.","Leadership studies Industrial and organizational psychology Leadership Social psychology Political philosophy","Management","Social Management"

Conservation issues are now at the forefront of public opinion - Nature is calling us to its wilds and we are responding in droves. The decline of natural rainforests, loss of endangered species, global warming and land degradation have galvanised public support for conservation. The interest in Ecotourism and nature-orientated tourism has coincided with this worldwide concern.Using relevant case studies, Ecotourism examines the potential positive social and environmental benefits of Ecotourism and is ideal for both students of tourism and practitioners within the tourism industry. 'Ecotourism' will also be of interest to environmental groups, land managers, academics and planners. Indeed anyone interested in examining what Ecotourism is and how it may hold the potential to solve or at least mitigate several of the great problems of our age. An example being arguably the greatest of these dilemmas: to satisfy human needs for employment, income and economic development, while at the same time protecting the environment.

However, while perhaps most famous for his work in the area of humanistic psychology, his legacy of work encompasses much more, extending into the realms of business and management. Having explored and studied the relationship between human behavior and the work situation, Maslow translated the science of the mind into the art of management=an important interpretation first published in the far-sighted treatise, Eupsychian Management, and whose impact continues to be felt today. Now, this seminal work has been updated, primed to introduce new readers to-and reacquaint old admirers with-what some have called the renowned psychologist's best book.  	Bringing into perspective the lasting impact of Maslow's groundbreaking principles, Maslow on Management illustrates how they have withstood the test of time to become integral components of current management practices, such as continuous improvement, Theory X, and empowerment. Offering insight into using these and other tools to effectively tackle present-day business situations, from heightened competitiveness to globalization to emerging technologies, Maslow on Management covers a wealth of timeless topics, including:   		Self-actualization-the freedom to effectuate one's own ideas, try things out, make decisions, and make mistakes  		Synergy-what is beneficial for the individual is beneficial for everyone; individual success should not occur at the expense of others; align organizational goals with personal goals  		Enlightened management policy-assume that all your people have the impulse to achieve; everyone prefers to be a prime mover rather than a passive helper; everyone wants to feel important, needed, useful, successful, and proud; there is no dominance-subordination hierarchy.   	To complement Dr. Maslow's original writings and to demonstrate how his forward-thinking ideas are being played out in today's business world, Maslow on Management features interviews with Perot Systems Chairman Mort Meyerson, Non-Linear Systems founder Andrew Kay, Esalen Institute founder Michael Murphy, and other prominent figures who provide incisive commentary on subjects ranging from creativity in business to leadership lessons for the digital age.  	Epitomizing the genius of its author and embodying his elegant ruminations, Maslow on Management is still as important as it was when it first appeared. A true classic, this is essential reading for all managers.","Human behavior Happiness Personal development Motivational theories Abraham Maslow Self-actualization Maslow on Management Motivation Humanistic psychology Need Maslow's hierarchy of needs","Management","Social Management"

Morgan makes his case by showing how theories of organization and management have been shaped by a few powerful metaphors-most notably those of the machine, the living organism, culture, politics, and, more recently, the learning organization, complexity, chaos, flux, and change. With this seminal work, he shows how managers can avoid superficial management fads by selecting metaphors wisely and then using them creatively to generate insights, ideas, and new ways of working.  	As the first book to offer a concrete method for integrating the strengths and overcoming the weaknesses of competing management perspectives, Images of Organization has established itself as a classic and influenced management thinking throughout the world. The new edition retains all the vitality of the original and has been updated to integrate significant research of the last decade.

But this style of leadership is ultimately ineffective and even dangerous. It hampers peopleÕs ability to anticipate and react to changing circumstances. And if the leaderÕs vision is flawed, the entire organization will suffer.  	In Real Leadership, Dean Williams argues that the true task of the leader is to get people to face the reality of any situation themselves and develop strategies to deal with problems or take advantage of opportunities. Leaders who are responsible with their power and authority don't dictate; they help people determine what shifts in their values, habits, practices and priorities will be needed to accommodate changing conditions and new demands.  	Williams details how to apply this new approach to six different challenges that every organization faces. Throughout, he uses examples from his own experiencesÑworking with organizations as diverse as the government of Singapore, Aetna Life and Casualty, and the nomadic Penan tribe in BorneoÑas well as historical examples and the insights gleaned from his many interviews with presidents, prime ministers, and business leaders to demonstrate the practical application of real leadership in the real world.

They look at how they inspire organizations through their creativity, virtue and faith, and thus show the faces of the artist and priest alongside the technical and rational face of the manager.  The Three Faces of Leadership features clear and accessible explanations of the aesthetic philosophy of management: as applied to the concepts of creativity, imagination, courage, virtue, inspiration, faith and ethics.

Here's how Westen's approach works:   		Balanced coverage of the four major perspectives (behavioral, psychodynamic, cognitive, and evolutionary) emphasizes the role of scientific method in evaluating each of these perspectives.  		Central Questions. Each chapter begins with the central questions that define an area of study.  		Throughout the text, students are brought back to these central questions.

In this book, acclaimed economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller challenge the economic wisdom that got us into this mess, and put forward a bold new vision that will transform economics and restore prosperity.  Akerlof and Shiller reassert the necessity of an active government role in economic policymaking by recovering the idea of animal spirits, a term John Maynard Keynes used to describe the gloom and despondence that led to the Great Depression and the changing psychology that accompanied recovery. Like Keynes, Akerlof and Shiller know that managing these animal spirits requires the steady hand of government--simply allowing markets to work won't do it. In rebuilding the case for a more robust, behaviorally informed Keynesianism, they detail the most pervasive effects of animal spirits in contemporary economic life--such as confidence, fear, bad faith, corruption, a concern for fairness, and the stories we tell ourselves about our economic fortunes--and show how Reaganomics, Thatcherism, and the rational expectations revolution failed to account for them.  Animal Spirits offers a road map for reversing the financial misfortunes besetting us today.

In Leveraging the New Human Capital, authors Sandra Burud and Marie Tumolo argue that to be successful, organizations must recognize a new ideal worker, a highly skilled individual whose heart and mind—as well as hands—drive results. This ideal worker successfully navigates the competing demands of work and personal life. Through interviews with corporate executives, critiques of the research, and four case studies of major corporations, Burud and Tumolo set out five practical strategies that companies must adopt to succeed in this new environment and the effects of these strategies on employee, customer, and organizational performance. Essays from guest authors Peter Senge, Robert Reich, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, and Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi introduce the ideas. Based on a research project funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and sponsored by the Drucker Graduate School of Management, this original contribution to the field of human capital management will appeal to managers, business thinkers, social scientists, and general readers interested in business and social trends.","Human resource management Industrial and organizational psychology Organizational behavior Labour law Organizational culture Talent management Job satisfaction Knowledge worker","Management","Social Management"

But Jennifer Kahnweiler shows that not only can introversion be managed, it can even be a source of strength. Ask Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, two of the leaders she cites as shy introspectives who have developed ways to thrive in a challenging environment.It is estimated that as many as 40 per cent of executives are introverted to at least some extent. Based on conversations with over 100 of these men and women, Kahnweiler lays out a progressive four-step strategy for succeeding in an extroverted world. First, preparation: carefully devise a game plan for any potentially anxiety-producing situation. Then presence: knowing that you’re prepared, be completely focused on the present moment or activity. Next, push: with a firm foundation of preparation and presence, go beyond your comfort zone.  And finally, practice, practice, practice.After a revealing Introverted Leader Quiz to help you deepen your understanding of where focused improvement will produce maximum results, Kahnweiler shows exactly how to apply the four P’s approach in six areas that are particularly difficult for introverts, such as public speaking, heading up projects, participating in meetings, and more.  The goal, she emphasizes, is not personality change—you work with who you are, not against it. In fact, she shows that introversion can actually be a plus in areas like listening skills and written communication. But as a result of reading this book, leaders and aspiring leaders who find it intimidating to be around people will learn to embrace the experience, rather than see it as something to be avoided or endured, and as a result advance their careers and contribute more fully to their organizations.","Personality tests Extraversion and introversion Personal development Popular psychology Self-help books Myers–Briggs Type Indicator Personality Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking","Management","Social Management"

Nielsen's new model is the """"peer-based"""" organization, which uses rotating peer leadership councils and crossfunctional task forces to manage the organization's work. These new entities are better suited to making decisions based on the organization's competencies and customer needs, rather than on static functional groups or other artificial divisions.

Instead, they employ financial tools, many linked to informal networks and family ties.

This included the characteristics of superior performance and the identifiable features of management control and performance measurement systems that drive improved performance along with relevant performance measures. But, there are often dysfunctional consequences of the drive for superior organizational performance. Numerous stakeholders are often impacted both positively and negatively by the drive for superior organizational performance. These stakeholders often include employees, customers, suppliers, the community, and others. Much current research focuses on how organizations and managers can minimize negative internal impacts and externalities and use management control and performance measurement to improve both organizational performance and the impacts on employees and society.  	This book contains a compendium of some of the excellent papers presented at a workshop on Performance Measurement and Management Control: Improving Organizations and Society in September, 2005 in Nice, France. Sponsored by the European Institute for the Advanced Study in Management (EIASM) and EDHEC School of Management, this workshop attracted leading scholars on management control and performance measurement from around the world. The primary questions addressed at the conference relate to the specific managerial actions that can be taken to drive superior organizational performance and the determination of the most appropriate measures of long term success in organizational performance. Many papers also addressed the social impacts of these actions.  	The papers in this volume approach these questions using a variety of research methods. Some are more theory based and most include some empirical research including interviews, surveys, and field studies. These methods are used to explain how management control and performance measurement can aid in the implementation of strategy and the improvement of organizational and societal performance. The approaches are used in both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations. The answers are not yet clear.

But despite its importance and the huge time investment it demands, most of us never learn what actually makes negotiation successful. Traditional strategies focus on logic, rational analysis, and game theory, minimizing the emotional aspects of negotiated interactions. Now Lacey Smith takes a fresh perspective. Emotions, he argues, can be harnessed to enable successful negotiation—and the results are always better for both parties. Get It! Street-Smart Negotiation at Work examines the emotions that are part of all decision making, emphasizing the importance of recognizing real motivations behind stated positions. This requires a combination of skills—asking the right questions, building a rapport with the other party, and understanding their true interests, as well as your own. These are the skills of street-smart negotiators, those who can build deals and resolve issues in ways that often seem to defy logic. Drawing on years of negotiating in business, politics, and law, Smith distills 65 """"Lessons from the Street"""" that make the process work. Eye-opening examples, called """"Street-Smart Realities,"""" drive these lessons memorably home. Using the techniques Smith outlines, you will maximize what you—and the other party—take away from the table.

Not only is OD a growing field in itself, it is also growing as a component of management, human resource development, industrial and organizational psychology, and human resource management.  	Organization Development is a new textbook designed to be used in undergraduate and graduate programs in any of these disciplines. Gary McLean provides readers with an overview of the field and acquaints them with the basic principles, practices, values, and skills of OD. Most of the existing books in OD have focused on narrow theory or practice perspectives, and focus more on process rather than outcomes. Organization Development successfully combines theory and practice; process and outcomes; performance and affective results; effectiveness and efficiency.  	McLean covers every aspect of the work of an OD professional and features case studies in every chapter. He explains how OD professionals actually get work and what the first steps in any OD effort should be. He surveys different ways to assess an organizational situation--including a comparison of the Action Research and Appreciative Inquiry models--and provides forms for devising an action plan based on that assessment. McLean then looks at how to choose and implement a range of interventions at different levels. Uniquely, Organization Development goes beyond the organizational level to look at the application of OD on community, national, regional, and global levels. And the book offers guidance on what to do afterwards, including how to evaluate the results of an intervention and how to resolve the controversy over adopting a particular change method versus remaining in a state of constant change.

According to mediation experts Kirk Blackard and James Gibson, dealing with counterproductive conflict in an organized, holistic, and systemic manner can lead to stronger and more resilient organizations. The responsibility for creating such a culture rests squarely on the shoulders of management.

For Peter Drucker, one of the most influential thinkers of modern times, the secret was “living in more than one world”—enjoying a diverse set of interests, activities, acquaintances, and pursuits. Drucker was able to do this despite extraordinary demands on his time, and now Bruce Rosenstein shows how the man who transformed organizational management can transform the way you manage your personal and professional life.  	An enormously influential business author and consultant, Drucker also wrote extensively on self-development and self-management, but these writings are scattered throughout dozens of books and articles. For the first time Rosenstein brings these ideas together into a straightforward framework that guides you in building a multifaceted life and career. It’s the next best thing to being mentored by Drucker himself.  	Rosenstein shares Drucker’s advice for, first, honing in on your core competencies—developing your main talents, clarifying your values, and managing your time. With this firm foundation established he uses Drucker as both source and example to show how to enrich your life by developing parallel and second careers, making a difference in the lives of others through voluntarism and service, and using teaching and lifelong learning as complimentary ways of staying engaged and up to date.  	By living in more than one world you gain new insights, see your world from fresh perspectives, access ever-changing sources of inspiration and stimulation. Peter Drucker managed a varied professional life as a writer, educator, and consultant, and was deeply immersed in literature, music, and art. But he wasn’t superhuman.

This has lasting impact in terms of meeting business objectives and becoming an employer of choice.

Neuroscience brings a new lens through which to look at people and to understand why they react to situations in a certain way, what they need from work relationships to perform at their best, and how they might be better motivated. Neuroscience for Organizational Change not only provides evidence that will persuade the most sceptical of leaders but also provides many practical examples of how to apply the insights. The book provides a 'win-win': it will enable the organization to improve performance and also help to support the mental and emotional well-being of employees. Amongst other areas, Neuroscience for Organizational Change explores why we find organizational change difficult and what we can do to keep people focused and performing at their best. It looks at our need for social connection at work, the essential role that leaders and managers play, how best to manage emotions and reduce bias to avoid making flawed decisions, and why we need communication, involvement and storytelling to help us through change. It also sets out a new science-based planning tool, SPACES, to enhance motivation.

Some 40 percent of new executives don't last 18 months. Why do so many employees with strong track records derail when promoted to the executive suite? In The Next Level, Scott Eblin draws on 20 years of experience as a leader and executive coach to identify why new executives fail—and offers a practical program for achieving success. Rising executives must understand that the strengths and actions that drove their career progress at lower levels—such as technical prowess—will not necessarily sustain their success as executives. They need to adopt new behaviors and beliefs, and, more important, let go of old ones. Eblin identifies nine sets of opposing behaviors that can make or break new executives and describes how to handle them. To illustrate his points, he interviews 30 accomplished senior executives who offer candid, mentoring stories about breaking into the executive ranks and what worked and didn't work for them. Beyond this tactical advice, Eblin provides a framework for transformational behavior and thinking—for creating executive presence, the confidence that is critical for success. The book concludes with a process for readers who want to identify their highest-priority development opportunities and work to improve their executive-level potential. The Next Level is essential for corporate leaders who have just been promoted to or are on track for the executive level, as well as for leadership development specialists and coaches.","Social psychology Industrial and organizational psychology Leadership Political philosophy Strategic management","Management","Social Management"

Standard economic theory did not give much credit to the role of networks until the early 1990s, but since then the study of the theory of networks has blossomed. At the heart of this research is the idea that the pattern of connections between individual rational agents shapes their actions and determines their rewards. The importance of connections has in turn motivated the study of the very processes by which networks are formed.  In Connections, Sanjeev Goyal puts contemporary thinking about networks and economic activity into context. He develops a general framework within which this body of research can be located. In the first part of the book he demonstrates that location in a network has significant effects on individual rewards and that, given this, it is natural that individuals will seek to form connections to move the network in their favor. This idea motivates the second part of the book, which develops a general theory of network formation founded on individual incentives. Goyal assesses the robustness of current research findings and identifies the substantive open questions. Written in a style that combines simple examples with formal models and complete mathematical proofs, Connections is a concise and self-contained treatment of the economic theory of networks, one that should become the natural source of reference for graduate students in economics and related disciplines.","Network theory Community building Social information processing Sanjeev Goyal Self-organization Systems theory Social network","Management","Social Management"

While most organizations recognize that the external communication between customers and shareholders is crucial to the success of a business, very few consider the implications of their internal communication or develop a clear strategy for it. So while management decisions may be perfectly rational, badly executed communication can leave staff across the organization confused, worried or disinterested. Strategic Internal Communication offers a complete approach to building engagement, performance and cultural integration in any organization. It looks at the relation between the traditional silos of internal communication, HR and employee engagement and demonstrates, using the new Dialogue Box approach, how to use communication more effectively and strategically to break down these barriers.",NA,"Management","Social Management"

In the past, business leaders have looked to the successes of other firms to guide their own strategies for increasing market share and capturing more consumer attention, spending, and loyalty. However, in today’s hyper-competitive marketplace, managers are looking for ways to shake, rattle, and roll corporate America’s traditional marketing and branding mindset.  In Brands That Rock, Roger Blackwell and Tina Stephan, co-authors of best-selling Customers Rule! and From Mind To Market, take readers behind the music to uncover how businesses can create brands that become adopted by culture and capture a long-term position in the marketplace. Brands That Rock takes a unique, behind-the-music look at how businesses can increase brand awareness, customer loyalty, and profits by implementing some of the same strategies that legendary bands have used to transform customers into fan and create deep, emotional connections with them.  Aerosmith and Madonna offer insight into how to evolve a brand to remain relevant in the marketplace without alienating current fans, while the Rolling Stones and KISS prove that successful execution at all levels of the brand experience are key to capturing long-term loyalty. Stephan and Blackwell also examine how businesses, from Victoria’s Secret and Wal-Mart to Cadillac and Kraft, have implemented ‘rock and roll strategies’ to become adopted by culture and secure fans in their own right.   Filled with fun anecdotes and interviews from industry insiders, Brands That Rock will relate to managers who grew up with classic rock, showing them how build iconic brands, and delight fans decade after decade.","Brand management Brand loyalty Brand Roger Blackwell","Management","Marketing"

According to Hulbert, Capon, and Piercy, when companies succeed it is often because every single person in every department -- from Sales to Human Resources to Finance -- has one paramount goal: to win and keep customers. Many of today's companies, however, have not heeded this crucial message. When they falter, it is often due to the fact that different departments report to different executives: then short-term goals like sales drive out the long-term necessity of marketing. Despite lip service to the contrary, the marketing departments of most companies often fail to reach their most important customers. Drawing on their combined experience of three-quarters of a century advising corporations, Hulbert, Capon, and Piercy argue that marketing must be dragged out of the marketing department. Indeed, it must become the top priority of the CEO, who automatically sets the tone for the entire company.  	The solution, the authors demonstrate, is to integrate the marketing imperative into every function of a corporation: finance, operations, sales, R&D, customer service, and human resources. This total marketing strategy has proven hugely successful for companies such as Intel, Canadian Pacific Hotels, Safeway, and Toyota.  Total Integrated Marketing provides an essential framework for designing and managing change so that companies can outperform their rivals. Containing a wealth of marketing tips and innovations easily adapted to any business, this is essential reading for all managers concerned about the future of their companies.","Marketing Marketing operations Sales Integrated marketing communications Draft:Nigel Piercy Marketing intelligence","Management","Marketing"

Over recent years this has changed considerably and a large proportion of the market capitalisation of any company is now likely to consist of intangible assets, such as its brand name. The value of names like Coca Cola, Microsoft, BMW and IBM is immense. However, although analysts and accountants are aware of the value of brands, many company managers still underestimate the importance of their brand. Careful management of a company's brand and reputation has become essential to its success. It takes time and effort to build a successful brand but this can become tarnished in days, with consequential damage to the value of the company.

When Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903, he proclaimed, """"I will build a car for the great multitude."""" Ford understood that the real profits to be had in the auto business were not in selling luxury items to the well-to-do, but in providing essential transportation for ordinary folks. To achieve this goal, he both changed manufacturing processes to lower production costs, and also doubled his workers' wages to enable them to buy cars--creating the phenomenal success of the Model T. Today, businesses have the opportunity to increase profits and improve underserved communities by selling to them, and hiring and purchasing from them. While previous books have touted business opportunities in these underserved markets, none have outlined the specific strategies necessary to turn this business concept into a detailed business model. Until now.  	Based on extensive research and featuring fifty case studies from leading corporations--including IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and Dreamworks--Untapped details the practical dos and don'ts every manager needs to know when approaching a new market. It shows how, by engaging consumers, workers, and suppliers, companies can create win-win partnerships with underserved communities. Corporations will discover a new source of increased sales, qualified workers, and marketable innovations as well as new ways to reduce costs and increase quality. The communities will get better products, more meaningful job opportunities, and an increased market for their own goods and services.  	Organized around five key success factors the authors identified during their study of pioneering corporations, this innovative book clearly outlines how to establish the kinds of win-win partnerships that are vital to succeeding in these complex but potentially rewarding markets. Combining practical tools, case studies, and careful analysis, Untapped provides concrete guidance for investing in and partnering with underserved communities to create not only significant competitive advantages but also vibrant communities in which to live, work, and do business.""","National Telecommunications and Information Administration Business Business models","Management","Marketing"

Yet most companies are not getting the return they expected. Is it possible to make customers happy and, at the same time, improve ROI? Is there a practical, affordable way to get customers to say what they really want?  	In Why CRM Doesn't Work, leading international marketing consultant Frederick Newell explains why it's time to change the game to CMR (Customer Management of Relationships). CMR allows companies to empower customers so they'll reveal what kind of information they want, what level of service they want to receive, and how to communicate with them--where, when, and how often. It is a bold solution for businesspeople at all levels in all industries who want to stay ahead of the curve in the development of customer loyalty.  	Newell shows by lesson and example why the current CRM isn't working, what needs to change, and how to put the CMR philosophy to work--without additional expense. The book includes case studies of good and bad relationship marketing from companies as diverse as Kraft Foods, Procter & Gamble, Budweiser, Charles Schwab, Dell, IBM, Lands' End, Sports Authority, Radio Shack, and Staples.  	With the knowledge in this book, a company can learn to build long-term relationships and bring in profits instead of relying on one-time sales.

Like a truly effective weight loss program, it is a plan for achieving sustained benefits--following the Wall Street Diet will add five to eight points of potential new profit to a business's bottom line.  	Using the proven concept of total enterprise optimization (TEO) as a framework, the book introduces a fitness program that brings together lean techniques, advanced supply chain management, improved quality concepts, selective outsourcing, and a focus on both the top and bottom lines. The authors detail specific TEO efforts that add savings and create new values, demonstrating the synergy to be had by combining those efforts with improved consumption data and analysis and innovative partnering with allied businesses. Fundamentally, The Wall Street Diet is about changing the culture that drives the business, leading to better earnings, continued growth, and the greatest value for all stakeholders.","Obesity Lean manufacturing Supply chain management Lean Weight loss","Management","Marketing"

Car shoppers can wander through the showrooms of over twenty automobile makers. For marketers, differentiating products today is more challenging than at any time in history yet it remains at the heart of successful marketing. More importantly, it remains the key to a company's survival.  In Differentiate or Die, bestselling author Jack Trout doesn't beat around the bush. He takes marketers to task for taking the easy route too often, employing high-tech razzle-dazzle and sleight of hand when they should be working to discover and market their product's uniquely valuable qualities. He examines successful differentiation initiatives from giants like Dell Computer, Southwest Airlines, and Wal-Mart to smaller success stories like Streit's Matzoh and Connecticut's tiny Trinity College to determine why some marketers succeed at differentiating themselves while others struggle and fail.  More than just a collection of marketing success stories, however, Differentiate or Die is an in-depth exploration of today's most successful differentiation strategies. It explains what these strategies are, where and when they should be applied, and how they can help you carve out your own image in a crowded marketplace. Marketing executives in all types of organizations, regardless of size, can learn how to achieve product differentiation through strategies including:   Revisiting the U.S.P. : Rosser Reeves's classic unique selling proposition approach, updated for today's marketplace  Positioning : Understanding how the mind works in the differentiating process  Owning an Idea : Techniques to seize a differentiating idea, dramatize it, and make it your own  Competition : How to use differentiating ideas against your competitors in the marketplace   Consumers today are faced with an explosion of choices. In this environment, distinctive product attributes are quickly copied by competitors, perceived by consumers to be minimal, or both. Still, those who fail to differentiate their product or service in the mind of the consumer won't stand a chance.  Differentiate or Die outlines the many ways you can achieve differentiation. It also warns how difficult it is to achieve differentiation by being creative, cheap, customer oriented, or quality driven things that your competitors can do as well.","Marketing Positioning Product differentiation Unique selling proposition Value proposition","Management","Marketing"

To stay competitive in the worldwide marketplace, business executives must lead their companies in developing and sustaining the ongoing efforts to globalize their organizations.  Vijay Govindarajan and Anil K. Gupta are two of the most distinguished experts in the field of globalization. In The Quest for Global Dominance they present the lessons from their ten-year research study of more than one hundred global corporations. Drawing from this rich knowledge base— which includes large-scale surveys, case studies, and in-depth discussions with several hundred executives— the authors make the compelling case that every industry must be considered a global industry and every business a knowledge business.  The Quest for Global Dominance focuses on four essential tasks in which a company must lead its industry in order to emerge and maintain its position as a globally dominant player. The richly illustrated conceptual frameworks presented in this book should help executives become more skilled at:   Identifying market opportunities worldwide and pursuing them by establishing the necessary presence in all key markets  Converting global presence into global competitive advantage by identifying and developing the opportunities for value creation that global presence offers  Cultivating a global mindset by viewing cultural and geographic diversity as not just a challenge but also an opportunity and being prepared to adopt successful practices and good ideas  Striving to reinvent the rules of the global game by rethinking answers to the classic questions: Who are our target customers? What value do we want to deliver to these customers? How will we create this value?   The Quest for Global Dominance provides executives with leading-edge ideas in a manner that makes them easy to put into action.","Capitalism Cultural geography Globalization Interculturalism International trade Sociocultural evolution","Management","Marketing"

Building on case studies of world-class brands such as Dell, Disney, Microsoft, Sony, Dove, Intel, CitiGroup, and PowerBar, Aaker demonstrates how powerful, cohesive brand strategies have enabled managers to revitalize brands, support business growth, and create discipline in confused, bloated portfolios of master brands, subbrands, endorser brands, co-brands, and brand extensions.  	Aaker offers readers step-by-step advice on what to do when confronting scenarios such as the following:   		Brands are underleveraged  		The business strategy is at risk because of inadequate brand platforms  		The business faces a relevance threat caused by emerging subcategories  		The firm's brands are tired and bland  		Strategy is paralyzed by a lack of priority among the brands  		Brands are cluttered and confusing to both customers and employees  		The firm needs to move into the super-premium or value arenas to create margin or sales volume  		Margin pressures require points of differentiation   	Renowned brand guru Aaker demonstrates that assuring that each brand in the portfolio has a clear role and actively reinforces and supports the other portfolio brands will profoundly affect the firm's profitability.

This book looks at different risks to supply chains and provides methods to reduce their impact.Constant pressure to improve the efficiency of supply chains, to move materials quickly and at low cost has given rise to a stream of new methods and initiatives. However, there is growing realization that they have created inflexibility that increases the supply chain’s vulnerability to disruptions. Evidence of major consequences are reported regularly in the news, from recent industrial action in American ports stopping the delivery of Chinese goods to Europe, to environmental disasters such as the 2004 Tsunami. But even a small, unexpected event has the potential to bring everything to a standstill including risks such as late deliveries, price rises, road accidents and traffic congestion.Supply Chain Risk Management introduces this important subject and explains why it is vital for managers to understand it. Using jargon-free, accessible language, it identifies both the possible effects that risks can cause and how to plan for them. Starting with a definition of risk and supply chain management, it explains the current trends affecting the supply chain and provides detailed guidance on how to identify and analyse risks. It develops the principles involved, describing the various approaches to take and the steps needed to implement it. There is advice on how to create a resilient supply chain and, in the worst case scenario, how to plan for and respond to an extreme risk. Interspersed with real-life examples of how risks in the supply chain have affected organizations, readers can learn from the past and take steps to ensure they are not victims of future risk.","Supply chain management Actuarial science Security Management Risk analysis Supply chain risk management Risk management Risk Supply chain Resilience IT risk management Supply chain attack","Management","Marketing"

Their huge scale and international reach, they claim, make them more efficient and profitable, better able to deliver value, and an uncontested boon for the job market. According to the big boys, locally owned small businesses are simply quaint remnants of the past, unable to compete in the global economy.  	But in The Small-Mart Revolution, Michael Shuman shows that the benefits these mega-stores and huge corporations supposedly deliver to communities are illusory. Crunch the numbers and you'll find that locally owned businesses turn out to be much more reliable generators of good jobs, economic growth, tax dollars, community wealth, charitable contributions, social stability, and political participation. Unlike their global competitors, they do this without massive tax breaks and subsidies that often put local economies in a permanent hole. Plus, contrary to popular belief, local businesses are competitive with the multinationals--and gaining ground every day. Shuman highlights numerous trends that are making the old """"bigger is better"""" economies of scale argument obsolete, and he describes a variety of innovative strategies these businesses are using to successfully compete with their over-sized competitors. He also shows how consumers, investors, and policymakers can support their own communities by """"going local.""""

Therefore they must use all the tools and techniques at their disposal to improve their chances of success. Applying the techniques advocated in this book can help managers beat the odds - and employees themselves - to have an impact on whether a deal will be successful both for the company and for themselves.  	This book looks at the process of a merger or acquisition and pinpoints the areas where business intelligence can raise the odds of success in each phase of the deal. Using techniques developed by governmental intelligence services and a wide range of recent case studies, quotations and anecdotes, the expert authors from the renowned Cass Business School show how to build success into any M&A situation.  	The first edition of Intelligent M&A was written in 2006 and published in 2007.  This preceded the peak year (2007) of the last merger wave, including the excesses in a number of industries and deals (e.g., financial services with RBS’ dramatically failed acquisition of ABN AMRO as a key example), and the global economic downturn that led to a completely new way of operating for many industries and companies.  	Therefore, there is a need to update the book to incorporate not just more relevant and up-to-date case studies of deals but to show the ‘new’ way of operating in a post-Lehman environment. Chapters will be comprehensively re-written and populated with new and relevant case studies.",NA,"Management","Marketing"
