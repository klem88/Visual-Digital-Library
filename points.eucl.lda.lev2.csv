This generic heading encompasses a seemingly endless array of finance instruments, including convertible bonds, mandatory convertibles, reverse convertibles, preferred shares, ELKS, DECS and LYONs, Within each one of these instruments are found a wide range of variations and features. These include reset, negative pledge, screw and forced conversion clauses, as well as step up coupons, call schedules, call options with soft and hard protection, etc,  The range of possibilities can seem bewildering, but it is this very flexibility which proves a huge attraction for investors, issuers and financial institutions. On the sell side companies issue these securities and corporate service departments advise on the type of options to include in them. On the buy side, investment managers seek to build portfolios with limited risk exposure using these securities and hedge funds utilize arbitrage opportunities between the convertible bond and the common share.  The opportunities are endless but the seemingly labyrinthine complexities can prove daunting. The Handbook of Hybrid Instruments helps steer a clear path through the maze. Izzy Nelken has drawn together a team of experts to provide in-depth analysis of many o key issues that both sellers and buyers require in order to operate effectively and profitably.  A general introduction is followed by specific information on key clauses and variations, valuation methods, the impact on a firm's value following the public issuance of convertibles, details on when an issuer should call a convertible and the impact of these provisions on the price, the difficult requirement of input data to make sense of the models, indexes and reset convertibles. Finally, a highly useful glossary is provided of all the key terms used in this field.  An analytical CD is also provided with the book, containing sample software of ConvB++. This combines complex state of the art models with a simple, user-friendly interface to assess fair values prices and to hedge parameters of hybrid instruments.

Recently, Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School introduced a new competitiveness theory, the so-called diamond model. He differentiated his theory from the traditional trade theories by arguing that national prosperity is not inherited, but created by choices; in other words, national wealth is not set by factor endowments, but created by strategic choices. He showed different choices of creating wealth, which had been quite limited in the world of traditional trade theories. His diamond model has lately been extended by several scholars.

In February of that year Deng Xiaoping passed away, thus marking the end of an era. Shortly after, the post-Deng Chinese leadership under Jiang Zemin had to mobilise great efforts to ensure the smooth resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong on June 30. This was then followed by intensive preparation for the holding of the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in September, which set national priorities for China's medium- and long-term development as well as decided on the core team of younger leaders responsible for leading China into the 21st century.  China is in the midst of great political, economic and social changes, which will intensify each other on account of their speed and scale. History has never before witnessed such a huge country as China industrialising and transforming itself so rapidly and so extensively. Accordingly, China's success or failure in its domestic development carries serious regional and international implications. There is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how soon in the next century China will become the world's most powerful economy. But what is happening in China today has already impinged on many aspects of life for people in the Asia-Pacific region, either in terms of growing trade and investment opportunities from China or in terms of regional security. This volume is largely based on public lectures and seminar papers by academic visitors and scholars at the East Asian Institute. Each has been written as a self-contained piece by a China expert, but presented primarily with non-specialist readers in mind.","Zheng Yongnian Wang Gungwu Deng Xiaoping China Jiang Zemin Deng"

With technological advances and market opening proceeding apace, and with globally oriented competitors taking aim at the last bastions of local dominance, globalization is at the top of the executive agenda of many companies that have historically considered their markets local or regional. Now, even start-ups and high-quality specialists, as well as formerly local monopolies like telecommunications companies and utilities, urgently need to develop a strategy for business without borders. Whereas previous research concentrated on articulating what global strategies look like in large multinational companies with decades of experience in operations abroad, The Leap to Globalization focuses on how globalizing is realized over time in companies that start from a narrow geographic base. Three characteristics differentiate globalizing as observed in current practice from simple international expansion. First, globalization implies a redefinition of customer value; second, globalizing is an entrepreneurial process that transforms the company; and third, speed plays an essential role in globalization.  Drawing on four years of field research covering twenty-two companies from sixteen industrial sectors, the authors -- both renowned experts in the field of strategic management -- provide a framework for managing the globalizing process. They show how companies can create new value from globalization by effectively marketing products, services, and competences anywhere, regardless of national borders. The analysis of both successful and unsuccessful cases reveals models of best practice in taking strategic action, building organizational competences, and adapting to changing risks. Concrete examples provide points of reference for achieving speed in globalizing without compromising sustainability.","International trade Cultural geography Sociocultural evolution Capitalism Globalization Interculturalism"

To stay competitive in the worldwide marketplace, business executives must lead their companies in developing and sustaining the ongoing efforts to globalize their organizations.  Vijay Govindarajan and Anil K. Gupta are two of the most distinguished experts in the field of globalization. In The Quest for Global Dominance they present the lessons from their ten-year research study of more than one hundred global corporations. Drawing from this rich knowledge base— which includes large-scale surveys, case studies, and in-depth discussions with several hundred executives— the authors make the compelling case that every industry must be considered a global industry and every business a knowledge business.  The Quest for Global Dominance focuses on four essential tasks in which a company must lead its industry in order to emerge and maintain its position as a globally dominant player. The richly illustrated conceptual frameworks presented in this book should help executives become more skilled at:   Identifying market opportunities worldwide and pursuing them by establishing the necessary presence in all key markets  Converting global presence into global competitive advantage by identifying and developing the opportunities for value creation that global presence offers  Cultivating a global mindset by viewing cultural and geographic diversity as not just a challenge but also an opportunity and being prepared to adopt successful practices and good ideas  Striving to reinvent the rules of the global game by rethinking answers to the classic questions: Who are our target customers? What value do we want to deliver to these customers? How will we create this value?

Should you tell your staff why you fired someone and risk being sued for defamation? Is it more important to make payroll or pay your vendors?  Business professionals face ethical decisions like these every day. Such dilemmas will keep even the most seasoned managers tossing and turning at night. You can rest assured that at some point in your career you'll be faced with making, or witness the making of, an ethical decision-and the action you take will not only define you, but also what your company stands for.  The pressure to make the right choices is incredible; indecision or one small misstep can be the kiss of death in today's highly competitive, fast-moving economy. Productivity can drop off, employee morale can plummet, dissatisfied customers can flee, and your competitor may take a large bite out of your profits-while the dilemma remains unsolved.  The Good, The Bad, and Your Business shows companies how to run more efficiently by improving their navigation of everyday moral business dilemmas. Respected writer and journalist Jeffrey Seglin reveals how otherwise decent people can make mistakes and find themselves in serious ethical trouble. His practical approach uses real-life examples to help you see the difference between a """"gray area"""" and an outright misdeed so you can act faster when faced with such ethical decisions.  Without being preachy or theoretical, The Good, The Bad, and Your Business looks at how others have faced moral dilemmas and gives you the tools to help you reach your own decisions. You'll see firsthand how businesspeople have grappled with difficult issues, from how to draw the line between lying and posturing, to whether it's ever ethical to spy on competitors, to how to align personal beliefs with business practices.  You'll also discover the common misperceptions about ethics in business and learn how to define your """"comfort"""" level so that you can conduct business knowing you've made thoughtful decisions with full knowledge of the possible consequences.

Though relatively simple in theory, understanding and making practical use of the equity risk premium concept has been dauntingly complex-until now. In The Equity Risk Premium, financial advisor, author, and scholar Bradford Cornell makes accessible for the first time an authoritative explanation of the equity risk premium and how it works in the real world. Step-by-step, his lucid, nontechnical presentation leads the reader to a new and more enlightened basis for making asset allocation choices. Cornell begins his analysis by looking at the equity risk premium in the light of stock market history. He examines the use of historical data in estimating future stock market performance, including the historical relationship between stock returns and risk premium, the impact of survival bias, and the effect of long-horizon stock and bond returns. Using the stock market boom of the 1990s as a case study, Cornell demonstrates what equity risk premium analysis can tell us about whether stock prices are high or low, whether the stock market itself may have changed, and whether indeed a new economic paradigm of higher earnings and dividend growth is now in place. Cornell analyzes forward-looking estimates of the equity risk premium through the lens of various competing approaches and assesses the relative merits of each. Among those scrutinized are the Discounted Cash Flow model, the Kaplan-Rubeck study, the Welch survey, and the Fama-French Aggregate IRR analysis. His insights on risk aversion theory, on the types of risk that have been rewarded over time, and on changing investor demographics all supply the sophisticated investor with important pieces of the risk premium puzzle. In his invaluable summing up of the equity risk premium and the long-run outlook for common stocks, Cornell weighs the evidence and assays the impact of a lower equity risk premium in the future-and its profound implications for investments, corporate decision making, and retirement planning. The product of years of serious analysis and hard-won insights, The Equity Risk Premium is essential reading for institutional investors, money managers, corporate financial officers, and all others who require a higher level of market analysis.","Stock market Equity securities Financial markets Corporate finance Investment Equity risk Equity premium puzzle Risk premium Financial risk Equity Stock Cost of capital"

As new forms of instruments proliferate, their complexity has grown as well. Even equity derivatives professionals are unlikely to know all the details about every existing structure. With equity derivatives comprising one of the most important components of the capital markets, it's more crucial than ever for every financial professional, specialist and nonspecialist alike, to understand how derivative instruments behave, how they're structured, and how to use them profitably. Edited by leading thinkers in the field, The Handbook of Equity Derivatives, Revised Edition, assembles dozens of experts from universities and Wall Street to help the reader gain a practical grasp of the growing variety of financial instruments and how they work. Contributions from such respected authorities as Gary Gastineau, Mark Rubinstein, J. Gregg Whittaker, and Fischer Black outline the full range of the equity derivatives market, from classic warrants, options, and futures to the new and innovative PERCs, equity swaps, and equity-linked bonds.  In nonmathematical language, the book provides a clear introduction to equity derivatives, including the fundamentals and history of options, basic equity structures, and pricing determinants, along with a historical perspective on their evolution. You'll find thorough surveys of:   The burgeoning field of synthetic structures-OTC options and exotics, equity swaps, SPINs, SIGNs, PENs, MITTs, and SuperShares  U.S. and foreign derivatives traded on organized exchanges  Issuer derivative structures, such as warrants, convertibles, PERCs, and unbundled stock units  The unique tax, legal, accounting, and regulatory features of derivatives  How to make the most profitable use of the many equity derivative products  Why some financial instruments succeed-and others fail  The future of the equity derivative market- place   Whether you're a finance student becoming familiar with the field or a practicing professional seeking better ways to exploit the tremendous potential of equity derivatives for profit, The Handbook of Equity Derivatives, Revised Edition belongs on your bookshelf.","Options Financial markets Equity securities Equity derivative Derivative Warrant Swap Financial instrument Structured product"

Applied Corporate Finance provides a user’s perspective to corporate finance, by posing the three major questions that every business has to answer, and then providing the tools and the analytical techniques needed to answer them. The three questions are-   Where do we invest our resources? (The Investment Decision) The first part of the book looks at how to assess risk and develop a risk profile for a firm, convert this risk profile into a hurdle rate, and develops the basic rules that need to be followed in estimating the returns on any investment.  How should we fund these investments? (The Financing Decision) Firms generally can use debt, equity or some combination of the two to fund projects. This part of the book examines the relationship between this choice and the hurdle rate to be used in analyzing projects, and presents ways in which the financing decision can be used to maximize firm value. It also sets up a framework for picking the right kind of security for any firm.  How much cash can and should we return to the owners? (The Dividend Decision) The third part of the book establishes a process that can be used to decide how much cash should be taken out of the business, and in what form — dividends or stock buybacks. The final chapter in the book ties in the value of the firm to these three decisions, and provides insight into how firms can enhance value.   In summary, this is a book about coming up with real solutions to real problems, using real-time data on real companies.","Corporate finance Stock market Shareholders Dividends Equity securities Dividend policy Dividend Finance Stock valuation Stock Equity Fundamental analysis"

More than public relations posturing or kowtowing to political correctness, social responsibility in corporations is proving essential to the long-term success of companies in today's globalized economy. Businesses must now contend with a globalized public that is increasingly aware of business' obligations to society and expects a level of accountability that most companies cannot meet. Good companies must go beyond merely being good-they must have integrity and a strategy aligned with it.  Integrity in business has traditionally meant being honest, upright, and ethical, but in response to globalization, companies are being forced to move beyond this definition and add to it another fundamental quality-integration with society. Corporations must anticipate and respond directly to the demands of public opinion rather than waiting for government intervention, mediation, and regulation to force them into action. When Good Companies Do Bad Things explores the strategic relationship between know-how, integrity, and integration, demonstrating how companies that fail to embrace the deeper meanings of these terms jeopardize their reputations and future prosperity.  The notion of corporations taking on social issues for the greater good is gaining momentum, not only because of political correctness but because it can strengthen a company's long-term strategy. Peter Schwartz and Blair Gibb examine well-known cases of companies like Shell, Nike, Texaco, and Nestlé, illustrating the huge financial risks of corporate assumptions that lead many companies to make poor choices. The authors present new approaches that demonstrate how it is possible to translate social value into business value.","Applied ethics Euthenics Social ethics Capitalism Globalization International trade Social responsibility Texaco"

Kaplan and David P. Norton, the concept of the Balanced Scorecard has achieved increasing popularity in the business world. Previously, many organizations had built their business objectives around financial targets and goals that bore little relation to a long-term strategic vision. Typically, this leaves a gap between the development of a company's strategy and its implementation.  The business scorecard, however, provides a more 'balanced view' by looking at not just-financial concerns, but also customers, internal business processes, and learning and growth. But it is not just a system of performance measurement - by focusing on future potential success it can be used as a dynamic management system that reinforces, implements and drives corporate strategy forward. In this book, the authors draw on their extensive experience with scorecard projects to provide a step-by-step method for introducing the Balanced Scorecard into an organization. This is done through the use of some of the most important practical examples in existence, with case studies from ABB, Coca Cola, Electrolux, British Telecom, Nat West, Skandia and Volvo.  The desired strategic control system using scorecards that is presented focuses on creating and communicating a total comprehensive picture to all members of the organization from the top down, a long-term view of what the company's strategic objectives really are, how to make use of knowledge gained through experience and the required flexibility of such a system to cope with the fast-changing business environment.  This book will provide senior and operational managers, consultants and business academics with a comprehensive view of emerging Balanced Scorecard practice supported by both business advice and a theoretical foundation. Reflections on the relations between the Balanced Scorecard and other areas, such as TQM, information systems and intellectual capital and knowledge management are also made.","Management Strategic management Business software Balanced scorecard Systems thinking Scorecard Third-generation balanced scorecard David P.

Car shoppers can wander through the showrooms of over twenty automobile makers. For marketers, differentiating products today is more challenging than at any time in history yet it remains at the heart of successful marketing. More importantly, it remains the key to a company's survival.  In Differentiate or Die, bestselling author Jack Trout doesn't beat around the bush. He takes marketers to task for taking the easy route too often, employing high-tech razzle-dazzle and sleight of hand when they should be working to discover and market their product's uniquely valuable qualities. He examines successful differentiation initiatives from giants like Dell Computer, Southwest Airlines, and Wal-Mart to smaller success stories like Streit's Matzoh and Connecticut's tiny Trinity College to determine why some marketers succeed at differentiating themselves while others struggle and fail.  More than just a collection of marketing success stories, however, Differentiate or Die is an in-depth exploration of today's most successful differentiation strategies. It explains what these strategies are, where and when they should be applied, and how they can help you carve out your own image in a crowded marketplace. Marketing executives in all types of organizations, regardless of size, can learn how to achieve product differentiation through strategies including:   Revisiting the U.S.P. : Rosser Reeves's classic unique selling proposition approach, updated for today's marketplace  Positioning : Understanding how the mind works in the differentiating process  Owning an Idea : Techniques to seize a differentiating idea, dramatize it, and make it your own  Competition : How to use differentiating ideas against your competitors in the marketplace   Consumers today are faced with an explosion of choices. In this environment, distinctive product attributes are quickly copied by competitors, perceived by consumers to be minimal, or both. Still, those who fail to differentiate their product or service in the mind of the consumer won't stand a chance.  Differentiate or Die outlines the many ways you can achieve differentiation. It also warns how difficult it is to achieve differentiation by being creative, cheap, customer oriented, or quality driven things that your competitors can do as well.","Marketing Positioning Product differentiation Value proposition"

Employing a carefully engineered financing mix, it has long been used to fund large-scale natural resource projects, from pipelines and refineries to electric-generating facilities and hydroelectric projects. Increasingly, project financing is emerging as the preferred alternative to conventional methods of financing infrastructure and other large-scale projects worldwide.  The intricacies of project financing are formidable, and can easily be misunderstood and, consequently, misused. While project financing structures share certain common features, by necessity, they require tailoring the package to the particular circumstances of the project. That is where both the benefits and the challenges lie.  As an investment banker currently with Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, John D. Finnerty has a wealth of experience in project financing. Now, he brings his considerable expertise to a comprehensive exploration of the facts, figures--and potential faux pas--surrounding Project Financing.  What distinguishes project financing from conventional direct financing is that rather than looking to the firm's entire asset portfolio to generate cash flow, in project financing, the project is """"a distinct legal entity"""" and the financing is tailored to the cash flow characteristics of the project assets. Such a structure can yield a more efficient allocation of risks and returns than conventional financing, but careful financial engineering is critical.  With actual examples and case studies, Project Financing takes you through the process step by step. It covers the rationale for project financing, how to prepare the financial plan, assess the risks, design the financing mix, and raise the funds. Along with cogent analyses of why some project financing plans have succeeded while others have failed, you'll find detailed information on:   Designing contractual arrangements to support project financing Issues for the host government--legislative provisions, public/private infrastructure partnerships, public/private financing structures  Credit requirements of lenders, and how to determine the project's borrowing capacity  How to prepare cash flow projections and use them to measure expected rates of return  Tax and accounting considerations  Detailed case studies--including Euro Disneyland and the Eurotunnel Project--that illustrate how to apply the analytical techniques described in the book   From funding sources and contract options to security arrangements and legal requirements, Project Financing provides the most complete coverage available today.""","Government procurement Public–private partnership Finance Public finance Corporate finance Public administration"

However, while perhaps most famous for his work in the area of humanistic psychology, his legacy of work encompasses much more, extending into the realms of business and management. Having explored and studied the relationship between human behavior and the work situation, Maslow translated the science of the mind into the art of management=an important interpretation first published in the far-sighted treatise, Eupsychian Management, and whose impact continues to be felt today. Now, this seminal work has been updated, primed to introduce new readers to-and reacquaint old admirers with-what some have called the renowned psychologist's best book.  	Bringing into perspective the lasting impact of Maslow's groundbreaking principles, Maslow on Management illustrates how they have withstood the test of time to become integral components of current management practices, such as continuous improvement, Theory X, and empowerment. Offering insight into using these and other tools to effectively tackle present-day business situations, from heightened competitiveness to globalization to emerging technologies, Maslow on Management covers a wealth of timeless topics, including:   		Self-actualization-the freedom to effectuate one's own ideas, try things out, make decisions, and make mistakes  		Synergy-what is beneficial for the individual is beneficial for everyone; individual success should not occur at the expense of others; align organizational goals with personal goals  		Enlightened management policy-assume that all your people have the impulse to achieve; everyone prefers to be a prime mover rather than a passive helper; everyone wants to feel important, needed, useful, successful, and proud; there is no dominance-subordination hierarchy.   	To complement Dr. Maslow's original writings and to demonstrate how his forward-thinking ideas are being played out in today's business world, Maslow on Management features interviews with Perot Systems Chairman Mort Meyerson, Non-Linear Systems founder Andrew Kay, Esalen Institute founder Michael Murphy, and other prominent figures who provide incisive commentary on subjects ranging from creativity in business to leadership lessons for the digital age.  	Epitomizing the genius of its author and embodying his elegant ruminations, Maslow on Management is still as important as it was when it first appeared. A true classic, this is essential reading for all managers.","Human behavior Happiness Personal development Abraham Maslow Self-actualization Maslow on Management Motivation Humanistic psychology Maslov Metamotivation"

The images in this book remind readers of how many hundreds of commercials they remember, and how their trademarked taglines have found permanent lodging in the language and culture—from “The Real Thing,” “Whassup,” “Priceless,” and “The Pepsi Generation” to “Just Do It” and “Do You Know Me?”  	Bernice Kanner highlights in pictures and words more than three decades of innovation and takes viewers inside the battles that marketers fight on game day: the cola wars, the beer battles, the sneaker showdowns, plus dozens more thirty-second plays for their car dollars, clothes budgets, finances—in fact, just about everything from their choice of computers and wireless services to the chips they dip and the ketchup they pour.  	It’s a journey viewers won’t want to miss.","Super Bowl commercials Television advertising Super Bowl Advertising Television advertisement"

Demands on the boards of directors of public companies throughout the nation are more acute than ever, and scrutiny is at new highs. There is a critical need for new insights and fresh approaches as corporate America addresses a real crisis in governance.  	Effective solutions are unlikely to come from increased government regulation, which is all too easily honored to the letter of the law while being effectively sidestepped in spirit. For example, companies like Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco, at the time of their catastrophic falls, would have received good grades for compliance with myriad guidelines subsequently passed to prevent similar debacles.  	Authors Newquist and Russell show clearly that the solutions need to come from within boards, by adherence to key cornerstones of good governance like duty of care, duty of loyalty, and a proactive intent to protect shareholders. Stressing a principles-based approach, the book outlines concrete procedures that enable accountability, transparency, performance measurement, and strong checks and balances. This insightful, highly readable book is a call to action and provides a plan to meet a modern board's challenges.","Corporate law Accounting scandals Management Corporate crime Corporate governance MCI Inc.

Yet most companies are not getting the return they expected. Is it possible to make customers happy and, at the same time, improve ROI? Is there a practical, affordable way to get customers to say what they really want?  	In Why CRM Doesn't Work, leading international marketing consultant Frederick Newell explains why it's time to change the game to CMR (Customer Management of Relationships). CMR allows companies to empower customers so they'll reveal what kind of information they want, what level of service they want to receive, and how to communicate with them--where, when, and how often. It is a bold solution for businesspeople at all levels in all industries who want to stay ahead of the curve in the development of customer loyalty.  	Newell shows by lesson and example why the current CRM isn't working, what needs to change, and how to put the CMR philosophy to work--without additional expense. The book includes case studies of good and bad relationship marketing from companies as diverse as Kraft Foods, Procter & Gamble, Budweiser, Charles Schwab, Dell, IBM, Lands' End, Sports Authority, Radio Shack, and Staples.  	With the knowledge in this book, a company can learn to build long-term relationships and bring in profits instead of relying on one-time sales.

Stephan and Blackwell also examine how businesses, from Victoria’s Secret and Wal-Mart to Cadillac and Kraft, have implemented ‘rock and roll strategies’ to become adopted by culture and secure fans in their own right.   Filled with fun anecdotes and interviews from industry insiders, Brands That Rock will relate to managers who grew up with classic rock, showing them how build iconic brands, and delight fans decade after decade.","Brand management Brand loyalty Brand Roger Blackwell"

In this detail, you can see some of the images that make the PhotomasaicTM on the cover of Drew Westen's new Third Edition of  Psychology. The photographers and illustrations, some of which are from the text, reflect the many diverse aspects of psychology.  	It's sometimes hard to make sense of so many disparate—and often conflicting—ideas and areas of study. But jist like the PhotomosaicTM, when you take a step back you can see the big picture.  	Drew Westen's clear, engaging voice and his comprehensive, accurate coverage of current topics in psychology help students make connections between key psychological concepts and understand the discipline as a whole. Updated and revided, the Third Edition features several new pedagogical tools that enable students see these connections more easily and think actively and critically about what they are learning.  	Here's how Westen's approach works:   		Balanced coverage of the four major perspectives (behavioral, psychodynamic, cognitive, and evolutionary) emphasizes the role of scientific method in evaluating each of these perspectives.  		Central Questions. Each chapter begins with the central questions that define an area of study.  		Throughout the text, students are brought back to these central questions. The chapter then concludes by returning to these questions and how the material has shed light on them.  		Apply & Discuss sections combine visual imagery with critical thinking to challenge students to apply what they have just learned. These can be used for in-class discussion or homework assignments.  		Making Connections sections link material from different chapters and sections to help students recognize the links between topics in different areas of the text.","Behavioural sciences Clinical psychology Cognitive science Psychology Emotion Mind Social cognition Psychotherapy Psychodynamics Developmental psychology Neuropsychology Subfields of psychology"

Once a marginal source of funds, securitization is now an essential corporate funding technique widely adopted by financial and industrial companies throughout the world to finance both working capital and capital budgets. It is also used as a risk-management tool and a source of liquidity. Securitization has been adapted to fund corporate acquisitions, to capitalize future streams of revenue, and to liquidate pools of nonperforming loans.  With examples from companies such as GE Capital, Ford Motor Credit, Countrywide Home Loans, and D&K Healthcare, The Securitization Markets Handbook provides descriptions of all major classes of asset-backed securities and offers a practice-oriented commentary on trends in securitization and the value of asset- and mortgage-backed securities across industries and throughout the global markets.  The authors approach the topic from both sides of the market: the supply side, where assets are securitized and mortgage- and asset-backed securities are issued, and the demand side, where investors choose which classes of mortgage and asset-backed securities will enhance their portfolios or serve as efficient hedges. The book’s detailed explanations and practical examples make it a valuable guide both for experienced money managers trying to put a securitization strategy into place and for those new to securitization looking to acquire a broad and strong foundation in the subject.","Structured finance United States housing bubble Fixed income securities Mortgage industry of the United States Mortgage-backed security Securitization Asset-backed security Secondary mortgage market Debt Fannie Mae Credit enhancement Renewable Energy Derivative"

Accountants, attorneys, and wealth managers all need to know about these responsibilities. But what, exactly, is meant by the term fiduciary standard? What must advisers do to be sure their procedures meet legal and ethical standards?  	This book identifies the 27 Prudent Practices, organized under the Five Steps, that were developed by the Foundation for Fiduciary Studies—measures that professionals can take to demonstrate that they accept, understand, and are fulfilling the role of a fiduciary.   		Financial advisers and others offering investment advice will add meaningful value to their practice and show tangible evidence of what sets them apart from the pack.  		Attorneys, CPAs, and others serving as trustees will possess the knowledge to determine whether or not their clients’ investment portfolios are being managed appropriately.

In this groundbreaking book, visionary business authors Stan Davis and David McIntosh argue that not only is this possible, but that applying an artistic sensibility to business will actually improve business performance.  	Traditionally, business focuses only on the economic flow of inputs (resources, raw materials), outputs (products and services) and processes that help get you from one to the other (research and development, production, distribution). Davis and McIntosh show that there's an artistic flow that operates the same way, but with different particulars. Inputs here include things like emotion, imagination and intuition; and outputs include things like beauty, meaning, excitement and enjoyment. To bridge these aesthetic inputs and outputs, the authors show how to apply creative processes from the arts to business, and how to connect with customers the way great performers connect with audiences.  	Through real-world examples and practical advice, The Art of Business shows how applying this concept of artistic flow enables you to come up with more creative solutions to problems, develop better new products, and provide your customers with the kinds of emotionally and aesthetically satisfying experiences they've come to expect in this high contact, mulimedia age. It gives you an additional--rather than alternative--approach to the established economic model of how things get done. And it will make your own work experience infinitely more satisfying.","Production economics Problem solving Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Creativity Educational psychology Flow Production"

It offers a refreshing vision of management control by organising its discourse around the fundamental challenges involved in the control process. Understanding these challenges will enable managers to enrich the way they create the tools that support the process. Chapter 1 offers a synthesis of management control’s scope and functions . It provides the reader with an overview of the themes developed in later sections : Part 1 is devoted to the challenge of measuring performance , which forms the basis of management control systems and comprises several different facets. A distinction is made between measurement systems elaborated at the corporate level and those devised at more detailed levels (business units) which comprise various perspectives. The section clarifies the principles on which each different measurement system is elaborated. Part 2 develops the control cycle and its two main components – planning and ex post results analysis – and highlights each stage’s goals and principles. These provide a framework that allows us to take a more nuanced look at the debate surrounding relevance of budgets. Part 3 takes a look at some important complementary questions , detailing the different types of Performance Programmes that companies have been developing alongside their management control systems. It also stresses the importance of information systems and the tremendous developments they have experienced recently.This book is aimed at managers – the principal players in the control process –, the controllers who animate the process, and students pursuing advanced management studies.

While MNEs are important, such a focus ignores the fact (1) that many smaller, entrepreneurial firms have also aggressively internationalized recently and (2) that MNEs often have to compete in emerging economies, which increasingly nurture strong local competitors. Most “mainstream” strategic management textbooks, while seeming to address the hot theme of globalization, contain only one chapter on “international strategy.” Finally, most international business textbooks do have a section (containing several chapters) on international strategy. However, they always carry a wider coverage of major business functions such as marketing, operations, finance, and accounting, making them unwieldy.  Global Strategy is written to offer a number of new perspectives. These include (1) a broadened definition of “global strategy,” (2) a comprehensive and innovative coverage, (3) an in-depth and consistent explanation of cutting-edge research, and (4) an interesting and accessible way to engage students. In this book, “global strategy” is defined not as MNE strategy only, but as “strategy around the globe.” Most global strategy and international business textbooks take the perspective of the foreign entrant, typically the MNE, often dealing with issues such as how to enter foreign markets. Important as these issues are, they only cover one side of international business, namely, the foreign side. The other side, naturally, is how domestic firms compete against each other and against foreign entrants. Failing to understand the “other side,” at best, captures only one side of the coin.","Global strategy Strategic management International business Marketing Springboard Theory"

In a sense, the economics of risk is a difficult subject: it involves understanding human decisions in the absence of perfect information. How do we make decisions when we do not know some of events affecting us? The complexities of our uncertain world and of how humans obtain and process information make this difficult.  In spite of these difficulties, much progress has been made. First, probability theory is the corner stone of risk assessment. This allows us to measure risk in a fashion that can be communicated among decision makers or researchers. Second, risk preferences are now better understood. This provides useful insights into the economic rationality of decision making under uncertainty. Third, over the last decades, good insights have been developed about the value of information. This helps better understand the role of information in human decision making and this book provides a systematic treatment of these issues in the context of both private and public decisions under uncertainty.","Decision theory Actuarial science Prospect theory Utility Probability Risk Uncertainty Expected utility hypothesis Decision-making Financial risk Risk management Modern portfolio theory"

Linear Factor Models covers an important area for Quantitative Analysts/Investment Managers who are developing Quantitative Investment Strategies. Linear factor models (LFM) are part of modern investment processes that include asset valuation, portfolio theory and applications, linear factor models and applications, dynamic asset allocation strategies, portfolio performance measurement, risk management, international perspectives, and the use of derivatives.  The book develops the building blocks for one of the most important theories of asset pricing - Linear Factor Modelling. Within this framework, we can include other asset pricing theories such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), arbitrage pricing theory and various pricing formulae for derivatives and option prices.

As with the first and second editions, this third edition of Strategic Information Management: Challenges and strategies in managing information systems aims to present the many complex and inter-related issues associated with the management of information systems. The book provides a rich source of material reflecting recent thinking on the key issues facing executives in information systems management. It draws from a wide range of contemporary articles written by leading experts from North America and Europe.  Strategic Information Management is designed as a course text for MBA, Master's level students and senior undergraduate students taking courses in information management. It provides a wealth of information and references for researchers in addition.","Information systems Information Human resource management Management Strategic management Strategy Information management Organizational culture Strategic information system"

Morgan makes his case by showing how theories of organization and management have been shaped by a few powerful metaphors-most notably those of the machine, the living organism, culture, politics, and, more recently, the learning organization, complexity, chaos, flux, and change. With this seminal work, he shows how managers can avoid superficial management fads by selecting metaphors wisely and then using them creatively to generate insights, ideas, and new ways of working.  	As the first book to offer a concrete method for integrating the strengths and overcoming the weaknesses of competing management perspectives, Images of Organization has established itself as a classic and influenced management thinking throughout the world. The new edition retains all the vitality of the original and has been updated to integrate significant research of the last decade. It has also been abridged and revised to increase its accessibility and usefulness for managerial audiences.  	Images of Organization-The Executive Edition is a monumental work. No other management book covers so much ground while developing the implications for management with such force. Morgan is a master of the links between theory and practice.

This movement is being supported by some of the major institutional investors who influence financial markets.  The main goal of Shareholder Value is to help working professionals grasp the concept of value 'creators' and 'destroyers', along with the implications. He also provides tools to measure the success (or failure) of major strategic and operational initiatives and enables corporate managers to understand how shareholder value is created, and then directs behaviour toward 'value-based' planning and action.  Although mainly aimed at the professional market, Shareholder Value will also be of use to students of business and finance as it is intended to provide a comprehensive foundation for important elements of business strategy and acquisition valuation, corporate financial analysis, capital investments, corporate financing and economic value based metrics.","Financial accounting Corporate finance Stock market Valuation Finance Mergers and acquisitions Shareholder Financial capital"

March uses literature to examine a set of dilemmas related to leadership - questions concerning the balance between private life and public duties, between ingenuity and innocence, between diversity and integration, and between the expression and the control of sexuality.

The buying power of the US Hispanic market is now larger than the GDP of the entire country of Mexico, and it is the second largest Hispanic market in the world. Businesses and institutions have launched major initiatives to reach this important segment. Yet, the number of qualified individuals who understand the market is small; and many of those already catering to the market still struggle to learn about its intricacies.

Recent case studies help marketers relate to the material pragmatically. The book integrates concepts and practical examples and provides critical guidance to discern between alternative courses of action.

Drawing on interviews with these famous CEOs, Mary Jo Hatch, Monika Kostera and Andrzej K. Kozminski demonstrate how business leaders today use aesthetics, specifically storytelling, dramatizing and mythmaking, to lead their companies successfully. They look at how they inspire organizations through their creativity, virtue and faith, and thus show the faces of the artist and priest alongside the technical and rational face of the manager.  The Three Faces of Leadership features clear and accessible explanations of the aesthetic philosophy of management: as applied to the concepts of creativity, imagination, courage, virtue, inspiration, faith and ethics. It presents techniques for developing these qualities as an essential part of leadership; together with the capacity to communicate them to others. Aesthetic leadership practices are linked to organizational culture, change, vision, values and identity. In this way, the book encourages students and executives to align the creative and spiritual aspects of business with their technical training and practice.","Monika Kostera Postmodern theory Storytelling Organizational storytelling Andrzej Kozminski Management Leadership Creativity"

Gone are the days when CEOs set agendas and earned 500 times more than average employees. Now, transparency rules. Corporations must establish new systems of accountability, and encourage long-term participation in decision-making by both shareholders and staff. Those that succeed will be better equipped to create wealth, solve complex problems, and compete in global markets.  The role of the directorate and the need to ensure an effective framework for its accountability to owners is paramount to success. In line with this thinking, Mastering Global Corporate Governance argues that one of the key responsibilities of the Board is leadership, and that the root of good corporate governance lies in the strength of a corporate leader. In particular, it focuses on two 'burning issues' for senior executives: how can the boards of global companies best lead their companies through the fundamental dilemmas that face all boards?; and how can Boards, entrusted with ultimate responsibility for the way a company exercises leadership, provide that leadership?","Corporate governance Corporate law Management Information governance Records management Governance Board of directors Chief executive officer Clause 49 Institute of Corporate Directors"

John E. Ettlie's three decades in the field of innovation as an instructor and researcher bring an exceptional perspective to this subject. His text is unique in its discussion of how technology has transformed the service sector. Few books on technology make the distinction between new offerings in manufacturing and the service sector which is emphasized in this text.","Design Innovation economics Innovation Management"

According to Hulbert, Capon, and Piercy, when companies succeed it is often because every single person in every department -- from Sales to Human Resources to Finance -- has one paramount goal: to win and keep customers. Many of today's companies, however, have not heeded this crucial message. When they falter, it is often due to the fact that different departments report to different executives: then short-term goals like sales drive out the long-term necessity of marketing. Despite lip service to the contrary, the marketing departments of most companies often fail to reach their most important customers. Drawing on their combined experience of three-quarters of a century advising corporations, Hulbert, Capon, and Piercy argue that marketing must be dragged out of the marketing department. Indeed, it must become the top priority of the CEO, who automatically sets the tone for the entire company.  	The solution, the authors demonstrate, is to integrate the marketing imperative into every function of a corporation: finance, operations, sales, R&D, customer service, and human resources. This total marketing strategy has proven hugely successful for companies such as Intel, Canadian Pacific Hotels, Safeway, and Toyota.  Total Integrated Marketing provides an essential framework for designing and managing change so that companies can outperform their rivals. Containing a wealth of marketing tips and innovations easily adapted to any business, this is essential reading for all managers concerned about the future of their companies.","Marketing Marketing operations Sales Integrated marketing communications Product marketing Draft:Nigel Piercy"

Building on case studies of world-class brands such as Dell, Disney, Microsoft, Sony, Dove, Intel, CitiGroup, and PowerBar, Aaker demonstrates how powerful, cohesive brand strategies have enabled managers to revitalize brands, support business growth, and create discipline in confused, bloated portfolios of master brands, subbrands, endorser brands, co-brands, and brand extensions.  	Aaker offers readers step-by-step advice on what to do when confronting scenarios such as the following:   		Brands are underleveraged  		The business strategy is at risk because of inadequate brand platforms  		The business faces a relevance threat caused by emerging subcategories  		The firm's brands are tired and bland  		Strategy is paralyzed by a lack of priority among the brands  		Brands are cluttered and confusing to both customers and employees  		The firm needs to move into the super-premium or value arenas to create margin or sales volume  		Margin pressures require points of differentiation   	Renowned brand guru Aaker demonstrates that assuring that each brand in the portfolio has a clear role and actively reinforces and supports the other portfolio brands will profoundly affect the firm's profitability.

It is estimated that there are more than 8000 Hedge Funds in the US alone. They have grown in popularity since the bear market of the early 2000s which convinced many people that they cannot just own stocks outright or inside mutual funds. Most investors understand mutual funds. They understand that the manager selects stocks and buys them. They also understand why they made (or lost) money in their mutual fund investments. T he same thing cannot be said about Hedge Funds which come in a variety of flavors. Even savvy investors are often hard pressed to explain the sources of return on their Hedge Funds. This book should be read by anyone who has invested in, or is considering an investment in, a Hedge Fund and also by anyone who is considering starting one.  The book explains the different types of funds as well as covering the key issues in every type of Hedge Fund. This book covers the entire gamut of the Hedge Fund industry. The authors explain the different styles of Hedge Funds (e.g. market neutral, convertible bond arbitrage, fixed income arbitrage and many more) and include a summary for each style of fund.

But bombarded by fads and fixes, most managers have been groping blindly to get their arms around the proverbial elephant.

In the process, the authors clarify the enormous amount of confusion that exists.  	The result is a tour de force: a brilliant, penetrating primer on business strategy that is, at the same time, immensely readable and fun. The authors provide a thorough critique of the contributions and limitations of each school -- from the design, planning, positioning, entrepreneurial, and cognitive schools to the learning, power, cultural, environmental, and configurational schools -- culminating in how they might combine to reveal that elephant.

In doing so, several important questions have been addressed in the literature, including:  	1. Do out-of-sample (point, interval, density, and turning point) forecasts obtained with nonlinear time series models dominate those generated with linear models? 	2. How should business cycles be dated and measured? 	3. What is the response of output and employment to oil-price and monetary shocks? 	4.

This included the characteristics of superior performance and the identifiable features of management control and performance measurement systems that drive improved performance along with relevant performance measures. But, there are often dysfunctional consequences of the drive for superior organizational performance. Numerous stakeholders are often impacted both positively and negatively by the drive for superior organizational performance. These stakeholders often include employees, customers, suppliers, the community, and others. Much current research focuses on how organizations and managers can minimize negative internal impacts and externalities and use management control and performance measurement to improve both organizational performance and the impacts on employees and society.  	This book contains a compendium of some of the excellent papers presented at a workshop on Performance Measurement and Management Control: Improving Organizations and Society in September, 2005 in Nice, France. Sponsored by the European Institute for the Advanced Study in Management (EIASM) and EDHEC School of Management, this workshop attracted leading scholars on management control and performance measurement from around the world. The primary questions addressed at the conference relate to the specific managerial actions that can be taken to drive superior organizational performance and the determination of the most appropriate measures of long term success in organizational performance. Many papers also addressed the social impacts of these actions.  	The papers in this volume approach these questions using a variety of research methods. Some are more theory based and most include some empirical research including interviews, surveys, and field studies. These methods are used to explain how management control and performance measurement can aid in the implementation of strategy and the improvement of organizational and societal performance.

As firms have cut back on consulting services and begun to review the way they use consultants, consulting firms themselves are looking at how they need to change. People are now talking about business consulting rather than management consulting.

The result of their effort is an original investment methodology called CROCI (Cash Return on Capital Invested), best described as a variation of the economic profit model.  For over a decade now, Costantinis group at Deutsche Bank has been using this valuation tool every time it has had to take a view on the pricing of an equity asset, be it a market, a sector or an individual sharein other words, every single working day, since it is this groups job to advise institutional investors on equity valuation. Costantini describes in detail, accompanied by concrete examples in the form of charts and graphs, the precise investment results of the actual implementation of the CROCI approach in the global equity markets since 1996. Readers will enjoy taking this journey with Costantini to see how and why the model was developed, assess the results of ten years of actual implementation and measure the successes of using this model in stock picking and portfolio construction. This book will also make it easy for them to see how the CROCI approach can be used successfully by others now and in the future.  The book is divided into four parts. The first part is a review and discussion of the fundamentals of investment analysis. The second part is dedicated to the construction of economic data, with the sole objective of calculating an economically meaningful asset multiple and relative return, the combination of which gives an economic PE ratio, the authors main stock selection tool. While the economic profit model is not exactly new, it is still largely ignored by the investment community. In essence, it does three things: it calculates the real amount of cash, or value created by a business; it compares the market value of an asset to an approximation of its replacement value; and it assumes that the former will converge to the latter through the arbitrage of investors and capital providers. The third part is dedicated to the analysis of economic data, and the last part deals with the actual implementation of the CROCI economic profit model, including real life examples. This final part also discusses how to use the output of the CROCI model with individual stocks, and then with investment portfolios. *Techniques are based on the authors performance record at Deutsche Bank since 1996 *Based on almost ten years of proprietary knowledge and implementation of these techniques *Factual illustrations of the results of the valuation techniques are provided at each step","Fundamental analysis Valuation Stock market Financial ratios Financial accounting CROCI Stock selection criterion Investment Discounted cash flow Finance Stock valuation Investment management"

The fixed income market particularly expanded to finance the government fiscal deficits commencing in 1975. However, growth in the non-Government side of the market for Japan has been a more recent phenomenon and a goal of policymakers in Japan and Asia since 1997.  	These markets are now second only to those in the United States and dominate the issuance market in the Asian Pacific region. The latter does not surprise since Japan is second only to the United States in debt issuance globally and in recent years has had one of the world's largest government bond and interest rate derivatives markets. However, these relationships are not static and the portfolio flows between Japanese fixed income markets, the Asia Pacific region and the rest of the world. This remains a matter of considerable importance for institutional investors, central banks and governments.  	The efforts of the authors who have contributed to this volume will measurably add to our understanding of the Japanese Fixed Income Market. This volume is structured into four parts: Macroeconomic Environmental Development, Credit Risk Measures and Management, Interest Rate Analysis and Market Integration sections.

The reader is expected to know basic probability theory and mathematical analysis, while all required concepts in financial and actuarial mathematics are developed in the text. The book outlines basic actuarial valuation concepts and then presents actuarial funding and valuation methods for defined benefit plans, and discusses their relationship to other types of pension plans. Optimal funding methodologies are developed in simple deterministic and in stochastic cases.  	The question of measurement of rate of return of a fund is analyzed in detail, pointing out how the choice of a market index affects it. The problem of stability of the value of liabilities is analyzed as well. Modern investment theory, including equilibrium and arbitrage models, is used to discuss ways to value both marketable and non-marketable assets, as well as liabilities. All commonly used methodologies of valuation of assets are listed and analyzed. Finally, financial risk management for pension plans is presented in detail, with emphasis on applicable asset-liability management methodologies. This portion of the book starts with the basics: duration, convexity, immunization, and develops alternative immunization methodologies, as well as other risk management tools, such as Value-at-Risk, Risk-Based-Capital, and shortfall constraint approach.  	A new optimal methodology, an alternative to classical immunization, is developed, and shown to be strikingly similar to conservative management approaches used by practitioners.

It's well known that these covert processes--such as hidden agendas, blind spots, office politics, tacit assumptions, secret hopes, wishes and fears--frequently sabotage change efforts, but up until now nobody has offered a rigorous, consistent way of identifying and dealing with them.  	Drawing on over thirty years of experience as an organizational change consultant to global corporations and government agencies, Robert J. Marshak shows precisely how to bring these hidden processes to light and deal with their negative impact. Marshak identifies five different dimensions of covert processes, presents an integrated model to explain the ultimate source of all of them, and shows how to diagnose whether any covert processes might be at work in your organization. He then offers specific tools and techniques for engaging and managing these """"under-the-table"""" processes and for creating the kind of organizational environment in which such hidden dynamics are unable to flourish. Covert Processes at Work is a comprehensive and practical guide that managers, leaders, and consultants can use to deal with the hidden dynamics that are often at the root of many organizational problems.""",NA

Their huge scale and international reach, they claim, make them more efficient and profitable, better able to deliver value, and an uncontested boon for the job market. According to the big boys, locally owned small businesses are simply quaint remnants of the past, unable to compete in the global economy.  	But in The Small-Mart Revolution, Michael Shuman shows that the benefits these mega-stores and huge corporations supposedly deliver to communities are illusory. Crunch the numbers and you'll find that locally owned businesses turn out to be much more reliable generators of good jobs, economic growth, tax dollars, community wealth, charitable contributions, social stability, and political participation. Unlike their global competitors, they do this without massive tax breaks and subsidies that often put local economies in a permanent hole. Plus, contrary to popular belief, local businesses are competitive with the multinationals--and gaining ground every day. Shuman highlights numerous trends that are making the old """"bigger is better"""" economies of scale argument obsolete, and he describes a variety of innovative strategies these businesses are using to successfully compete with their over-sized competitors. He also shows how consumers, investors, and policymakers can support their own communities by """"going local.""""

In Making the Impossible Possible, Kim Cameron and Marc Lavine explain how this remarkable feat was achieved--and how breakthrough levels of performance can be achieved by any organization.  	After analyzing numerous firsthand accounts and public records, Cameron and Lavine realized that the leaders of the Rocky Flats cleanup took a distinctive """"abundance approach"""" to the task.

These are difficult and complex problems, but our government's strategy for dealing with them has been essentially not to deal with them at all. Over and over, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, we're told that we're on our own--""""Here's a tax cut and a private account; now go fend for yourself.""""  	As Jared Bernstein points out, this approach doesn't make any sense as a strategy for solving the enormous systemic problems we face. It's just a way of shifting economic risk from those most able to bear it--the government and the nation's corporations--to those least able: individuals and families. The result has been greater wealth for the top 1 percent of Americans and stagnant living standards and increasing insecurity for the vast majority.  	In All Together Now, Bernstein outlines a new strategy, one that applauds individual initiative but recognizes that the problems we face as a nation can be solved only if we take a more collaborative approach. The message is simple: we're all in this together.  	Bernstein draws on recent and historic events to explore how the proponents of what he dubs the YOYO (you're-on-your-own) approach have sold the idea, exposing the fallacies and ulterior motives in their arguments as well as the disasterous consequences of their policies. More importantly, he details practical WITT (we're-in-this-together) initiatives in specific areas like globalization, health care, and employment that could improve the lives of millions of Americans without increasing overall national spending. And he offers advice on how to overcome objections to the WITT agenda and bring the country together so that both risks and benefits are shared more fairly.  	While the prevailing philosophy insists that all we can do is cope with massive social forces, each of us on our own, Bernstein argues that we can unite and shape these forces to meet our needs. The optimistic message of All Together Now is that the economic challenges we face are not insoluble; we can wield the tools of government to meet them in such a way as to build a more just and equitable society.""","International business Offshore finance Offshoring Outsourcing Jared Bernstein Risk All Together Now"

From his inside vantage point as the company's first general manager and chief operating officer, Roger Frock reveals the remarkable details of how Fred Smith and his team endured their tumultuous early years--fraught with a seemingly unending series of legal, financial, and operational crises that continually threatened the company's ability to stay in business--and, in the end, created an entirely new industry.  	Frock chronicles the dramatic last-minute saves and turnarounds the company engineered from its inception to the present. He entertains with stories of the trials and tribulations of the company's early struggles and victories--from Pilots using personal credit cards to fuel planes, to the courier who hocked his watch to put gas in his delivery van, and, one of the most memorable episodes, the time that founder Fred Smith literally gambled the company's last remaining funds to keep the planes flying.  	Frock's story introduces all the players--FedEx's resourceful and resilient leaders and employees--and shows how these remarkable individuals gave Fred Smith's original concept wings and, through flexibility, creativity, and commitment, made a fledgling startup into one of the great success stories in modern business. Changing How the World Does Business is an inspirational tale for leaders and entrepreneurs everywhere.","Express mail FedEx Trucking industry in the United States Courier"

But this style of leadership is ultimately ineffective and even dangerous. It hampers peopleÕs ability to anticipate and react to changing circumstances. And if the leaderÕs vision is flawed, the entire organization will suffer.  	In Real Leadership, Dean Williams argues that the true task of the leader is to get people to face the reality of any situation themselves and develop strategies to deal with problems or take advantage of opportunities. Leaders who are responsible with their power and authority don't dictate; they help people determine what shifts in their values, habits, practices and priorities will be needed to accommodate changing conditions and new demands.  	Williams details how to apply this new approach to six different challenges that every organization faces. Throughout, he uses examples from his own experiencesÑworking with organizations as diverse as the government of Singapore, Aetna Life and Casualty, and the nomadic Penan tribe in BorneoÑas well as historical examples and the insights gleaned from his many interviews with presidents, prime ministers, and business leaders to demonstrate the practical application of real leadership in the real world.

After all, business is conducted via relationships, and trust is the foundation to effective relationships. Yet, trust means different things to different people and this is a big part of the problem.  	Collectively drawing on thirty years of research and experience with organizations around the world, Dennis and Michelle Reina put people on the same page. The Reinas provide a simple and comprehensive approach that works! Their approach outlines a common language to discuss trust constructively, identifies specific behaviors that build and break trust, and it describes steps for rebuilding trust and sustaining it over time, even during periods of change.  	Trust takes time to develop; it is easy to lose and hard to regain. It is a fragile yet indispensable element in any relationship. Betrayal, or the loss of trust, is the focus of countless fiscal scandals, all of which ultimately resulted from a lapse in trust. However, it is not just these major lapses of integrity that break trust. Trust is broken in subtle ways every day in every workplace.  	As a result, countless numbers of people in the workplace today are in pain, and many organizations are hurting. After years of constant change--downsizing, restructuring, or of mergers and acquisition--trust among people in organization is at an all-time low.  	We have all felt the pain of a breach of trust or even a betrayal during the course of our working careers. Unmet expectations, disappointments, broken trust, and betrayals aren't restricted to big events like restructurings and downsizings. They crop up every day on the job. The Reina's show us the shape and form betrayal takes, its impact on relationships and performance, and most importantly what we can do to rebuild trust.  Trust & Betrayal in the Workplace helps us see the natural role trust and betrayal plays in our lives, how we can rebuild trust and transform workplace relationships. It provides new examples, highly practical tips, tools, and exercises to help readers create work environments where trust grows, where people feel good about what they do, where relationships are energized, and productivity and profits accelerate.","Social psychology Accountability Emotions Reputation management Social epistemology Trust Betrayal Dennis Reina"

Ford understood that the real profits to be had in the auto business were not in selling luxury items to the well-to-do, but in providing essential transportation for ordinary folks. To achieve this goal, he both changed manufacturing processes to lower production costs, and also doubled his workers' wages to enable them to buy cars--creating the phenomenal success of the Model T. Today, businesses have the opportunity to increase profits and improve underserved communities by selling to them, and hiring and purchasing from them. While previous books have touted business opportunities in these underserved markets, none have outlined the specific strategies necessary to turn this business concept into a detailed business model. Until now.  	Based on extensive research and featuring fifty case studies from leading corporations--including IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and Dreamworks--Untapped details the practical dos and don'ts every manager needs to know when approaching a new market. It shows how, by engaging consumers, workers, and suppliers, companies can create win-win partnerships with underserved communities. Corporations will discover a new source of increased sales, qualified workers, and marketable innovations as well as new ways to reduce costs and increase quality. The communities will get better products, more meaningful job opportunities, and an increased market for their own goods and services.  	Organized around five key success factors the authors identified during their study of pioneering corporations, this innovative book clearly outlines how to establish the kinds of win-win partnerships that are vital to succeeding in these complex but potentially rewarding markets.

In the 1990s, it became possible to do so by answering 15 general knowledge questions correctly or by picking six numbers in the National Lottery. And for a brief moment in late 1999 and early 2000, it seemed possible to make a million by setting up, working for, or even investing in an Internet company.  This book examines the immense cultural changes that lie behind these changes. Government restrictions on gambling and TV quiz show prizes have been swept away. The growth of venture capital and share options have vastly increased the attractiveness of establishing, and working for, new businesses.  But it also warns of the dangers when investors treat the stock market as a slightly more complex version of the National Lottery. Fortunes were made and lost as companies with no profits and uncertain futures saw their share prices soar and then collapse. First-time investors were encouraged into the stock market by the government and by the financial services industry but were thrown in at the deep end--with only some dubious newspaper and Internet bulletin board tips to guide them. It is a cautionary tale of greed and delusion--how the pursuit of easy money led many Britons astray.

What matters is share price and what drives share price is the creation of shareholder value. Many marketing directors, obsessed with branding and other promotional tactics, miss this fundamental truth of modern business and so destroy the wealth of their company's ultimate owners. By failing to consider and manage the business risk associated with their strategies, they deliver returns below the cost of capital and neglect the firm's raison d'etre. The board needs a way of holding these marketers to account.  Marketing Due Diligence is a new process which has emerged from years of research at Cranfield, one of Europe's leading business schools. It blends proven ideas from strategic and financial management with new concepts about organisational effectiveness to create a process that directly connects marketing strategy to shareholder value.

Academic books are typically concerned primarily with measurement techniques, and devote only a small section to describing the applications, usually without discussing the problems that changing organizational processes in banks may have on business units' behaviour. Practitioners' books are often based on a single experience, presenting the approach that has been pursued by a single bank, but often do not adequately evaluate that approach. In actual practice, the choice of how to use Value at Risk and risk-adjusted performance measures has no single optimal solution, but requires effective decision making that can identify the solution that is consistent with the bank's style of management and coordination mechanisms, and often with characteristics of individual business units as well.  In this book, Francesco Saita of Bocconi University argues that even though risk measurement techniques have greatly improved in recent years for market, credit and now also operational risk, capital management and capital allocation decisions are far from becoming purely technical and mechanical. On one hand, decisions about capital management must consider handling different capital constraints (e.g. regulatory vs. economic capital ) and face remarkable difficulties in providing a measure of """"aggregated"""" Value at Risk (i.e. a measure that considers the overall value at risk of the bank after diversification across risk types). On the other hand, the aim of using capital more efficiently through capital allocation cannot be achieved only through a sort of centralized asset allocation process, but rather by designing a Value at Risk limit system and a risk-adjusted performance measurement system that are designed to provide the right incentives to individual business units.  This connection between sophisticated and cutting edge risk measurement techniques and practical bank decision making about capital management and capital allocation make this book unique and provide readers with a depth of academic and theoretical expertise combined with practical and real-world understanding of bank structure, organizational constraints, and decisionmaking processes.""","Actuarial science Financial risk Risk Risk-adjusted return on capital Risk management Operational risk Economic capital Credit risk CAMELS rating system Enterprise risk management"

Pragmatic and practical, The Courage to Act puts the art of acting with courage within reach of any employee who wants to achieve extraordinary results at work. From fieldwork that has spanned four continents and dozens of countries- from Fortune 500 companies to the Israeli military- comes powerful lessons of how team members at all levels chose to make a difference when faced with everyday moments of truth, when individual strength and character were put to the test. With thought-provoking case studies, the authors' unique Courage Index, questionnaires, and other hands-on tools, this simple yet dynamic approach for fostering, training, and measuring courage details the five factors needed to face adversity, seize opportunities, deal with ambiguity, and achieve extraordinary results: candor, purpose, will, rigor, and risk.","Virtue Courage"

This ideal worker successfully navigates the competing demands of work and personal life.

And nowhere is the need more critical than on the front line, where team leaders, unit managers, and human resource professionals struggle to find an easier way to use numbers to align people and processes with corporate purpose. Demystifying such popular systems as balanced scorecards and Six Sigma, Measuring What Matters finally brings the power of measurement down from the lofty realm of strategy to where the real work gets done: inside work teams. Napier and McDaniel introduce the notion of balanced stakeholder feedback as they lay out a simple yet powerful process for translating organizational vision into measures, and measures into action. Immediately actionable at the team level, independent of outside consultants or company-wide commitment, this one-of-a-kind tool kit details step by step how to identify a team's key stakeholders, determine what each core group values and expects, and assess how well the team and stakeholders meet each other's expectations. A Power Tools for Management section is jampacked with instruments to gather measurable information, case studies to understand the data, reproducible exercises, and original diagnostic tools to unleash the power of metrics to improve leadership competencies, motivate teams, measure and build trust, reduce employee absenteeism, shorten production cycle times, and increase profits.","Public relations Human resource management Administration Business Management Stakeholder Competence"

According to mediation experts Kirk Blackard and James Gibson, dealing with counterproductive conflict in an organized, holistic, and systemic manner can lead to stronger and more resilient organizations. The responsibility for creating such a culture rests squarely on the shoulders of management.

This book provides an in-depth look at dynamic governance, the key to success in a world of rapid, increasing globalization and unrelenting technological advancements. If bureaucratic public institutions can evolve and embed the culture and capabilities that enable continuous learning and change, their contributions to a country's socio-economic progress and prosperity would be enormous. The lessons from their efforts in institutionalizing culture, capabilities and change could provide meaningful and valuable insights for transforming organizations in other contexts.","Accountability Governance Political engineering Political philosophy Development Global governance Good governance"

A pervasive part of the Chinese business world for the last few centuries, it binds literally millions of Chinese firms into a social and business web. Any business in this society, including local firms and foreign investors and marketers, inevitably faces guanxi dynamics. In China’s new, fast-paced business environment, guanxi has been more entrenched than ever, heavily influencing Chinese social behavior and business practice. However, as in other emerging economies, corruption in China is becoming more rampant, which makes guanxi and corruption often intermingled. As such, business executives need to place greater caution today in the practice and process of guanxi development and utilization. Due to the growing academic and practical interest in guanxi, this second edition provides a timely update to the systematic and vigorous exploration of the various social, economic, cultural, and business issues relating to the complex concept and practice of guanxi.","Chinese society Chinese culture Guanxi Social psychology Corruption Political corruption Social capital"

At the turn of the century, the Chinese economy faces a series of challenges to sustain its growth and stability. The two-decade-long rapid growth has effectively strengthened China's economic power and raised its people's standard of living. It has also transformed China from a centrally planned command economy into a """"socialist market economy"""", which operates increasingly in line with capitalist norms. Major structural problems, however, remain and are growing acute. Weakness in the fiscal system breeds rent seeking at the local level and causes tension in the state budget. The flawed financial institutions and the biased ownership structure continue to distort resource allocation and cause huge efficiency losses. Inter-provincial and inter-regional disparity is reaching a level that threatens national unity and social stability. As China joins the World Trade Organization and becomes more integrated into the world economy, it urgently needs to improve the domestic business environment and to beef up indigenous industries for foreign competition. This volume is a collection of papers written by scholars at the East Asian Institute to address those problems during the period 1999–2001. The authors, with their knowledge and experience in China studies, provide in-depth observations and professional analyses of some of the most important issues for the Chinese economy at the turn of the century. Some of the observations and analyses lead to enlightening policy recommendations. The solid scholarship combined with the policy orientation of these papers will appeal greatly to researchers in academia, governments and other institutions. The policy-oriented and fact-based analyses will also be of interest to practitioners in business, including business consultants.""","China Republics Chinese financial system China Economic Yearbook"

Of prime importance for corporate survival and growth in all sectors and countries is the crucial shift from owner–founder–run companies to consolidated management-led corporations. The wide range of sectors and countries of origin featured also permits valid conclusions on the persistence of distinctive national management styles and brand images.

It introduces first year Ph.D. students to standard graduate econometrics material from a modern perspective. It covers all the standard material necessary for understanding the principal techniques of econometrics from ordinary least squares through cointegration. The book is also distinctive in developing both time-series and cross-section analysis fully, giving the reader a unified framework for understanding and integrating results. Econometrics has many useful features and covers all the important topics in econometrics in a succinct manner. All the estimation techniques that could possibly be taught in a first-year graduate course, except maximum likelihood, are treated as special cases of GMM (generalized methods of moments). Maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of models (such as probit and tobit) are collected in a separate chapter. This arrangement enables students to learn various estimation techniques in an efficient manner. Eight of the ten chapters include a serious empirical application drawn from labor economics, industrial organization, domestic and international finance, and macroeconomics. These empirical exercises at the end of each chapter provide students a hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the chapter. The exposition is rigorous yet accessible to students who have a working knowledge of very basic linear algebra and probability theory. All the results are stated as propositions, so that students can see the points of the discussion and also the conditions under which those results hold. Most propositions are proved in the text. For those who intend to write a thesis on applied topics, the empirical applications of the book are a good way to learn how to conduct empirical research. For the theoretically inclined, the no-compromise treatment of the basic techniques is a good preparation for more advanced theory courses.","Econometrics Estimation theory Regression analysis Time series analysis Parametric statistics Ordinary least squares Maximum likelihood Cointegration Least squares Heteroscedasticity Linear regression M-estimator"

Though both focus on the same broad problem, investment decision-making, the gap between the two sides--and between theory and practice--remains embarrassingly large. This book synthesizes cutting-edge developments in corporate finance and related fields--in particular, real options and game theory--to help bridge this gap. In clear, straightforward exposition and through numerous examples and applications from various industries, Han Smit and Lenos Trigeorgis set forth an extended valuation framework for competitive strategies. The book follows a problem-solving approach that synthesizes ideas from game theory, real options, and strategy. Thinking in terms of options-games can help managers address questions such as: When is it best to invest early to preempt competitive entry, and when to wait? Should a firm compete in R&D or adopt an accommodating stance? How does one value growth options or infrastructure investments? The authors provide a wide range of valuation examples, such as acquisition strategies, R&D investment in high-tech sectors, joint research ventures, product introductions in consumer electronics, infrastructure, and oil exploration investment. Representing a major step beyond standard real options or strategy analysis, and extending the power of real options and strategic thinking in a rigorous fashion, Strategic Investment will be an indispensable guide and resource for corporate managers, MBA students, and academics alike.","Real options Management Strategic management Strategy Systems thinking Lenos Trigeorgis Corporate finance Quantitative analyst Finance Valuation Real options valuation"

The methodological rigor, scope, and sophistication of their state-of-the-art account is unparalleled, and its singularly in-depth treatment of pricing and credit derivatives further illuminates a problem that has drawn much attention in an era when financial institutions the world over are revising their credit management strategies. Duffie and Singleton offer critical assessments of alternative approaches to credit-risk modeling, while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current practice. Their approach blends in-depth discussions of the conceptual foundations of modeling with extensive analyses of the empirical properties of such credit-related time series as default probabilities, recoveries, ratings transitions, and yield spreads. Both the """"structura"""" and """"reduced-form"""" approaches to pricing defaultable securities are presented, and their comparative fits to historical data are assessed. The authors also provide a comprehensive treatment of the pricing of credit derivatives, including credit swaps, collateralized debt obligations, credit guarantees, lines of credit, and spread options. Not least, they describe certain enhancements to current pricing and management practices that, they argue, will better position financial institutions for future changes in the financial markets.

Whereas once the subject addressed mainly the financing of corporations--equity, debt, and valuation--today it also embraces crucial issues of governance, liquidity, risk management, relationships between banks and corporations, and the macroeconomic impact of corporations. However, this progress has left in its wake a jumbled array of concepts and models that students are often hard put to make sense of. Here, one of the world's leading economists offers a lucid, unified, and comprehensive introduction to modern corporate finance theory. Jean Tirole builds his landmark book around a single model, using an incentive or contract theory approach. Filling a major gap in the field, The Theory of Corporate Finance is an indispensable resource for graduate and advanced undergraduate students as well as researchers of corporate finance, industrial organization, political economy, development, and macroeconomics. Tirole conveys the organizing principles that structure the analysis of today's key management and public policy issues, such as the reform of corporate governance and auditing; the role of private equity, financial markets, and takeovers; the efficient determination of leverage, dividends, liquidity, and risk management; and the design of managerial incentive packages. He weaves empirical studies into the book's theoretical analysis. And he places the corporation in its broader environment, both microeconomic and macroeconomic, and examines the two-way interaction between the corporate environment and institutions. Setting a new milestone in the field, The Theory of Corporate Finance will be the authoritative text for years to come.","Financial markets Credit United States housing bubble Financial crises Systemic risk Liquidity risk Corporate finance Finance Market liquidity Credit crunch Corporate governance Private equity"

The terms of these contracts depend on the information available to insurance firms. Unlike age and gender, information about individual survival probabilities cannot be readily ascertained. This asymmetric information causes market inefficiencies, such as adverse selection. Groundbreaking in its scope, The Economic Theory of Annuities offers readers a theoretical analysis of the functioning of private annuity markets. Starting with a general analysis of survival functions, stochastic dominance, and characterization of changes in longevity, Eytan Sheshinski derives the demand for annuities using a model of individuals who jointly choose their lifetime consumption and retirement age. The relation between life insurance and annuities that have a bequest option is examined and """"annuity options"""" are proposed as a response to the lack of secondary markets. This book also investigates the macroeconomic policy implications of annuities and changes in longevity on aggregate savings. Sheshinski utilizes statistical population theory to shed light on the debate of whether the surge in savings and growth in Asia and other countries can be attributed to higher longevity of the population and whether this surge is durable. This book shows how understanding annuities becomes essential as governments that grapple with insolvency of public social security systems place greater emphasis on individual savings accounts.""","Actuarial science Investment Insurance Retirement Life annuity Annuity Equity-indexed annuity Fixed annuity"

The book focuses on and provides a critical assessment of models of rational economic agents, and it contains a large number of original problems. Rubinstein, one of the world's most-respected economics theorists, has made substantial contributions to several fields in economics, particularly game theory. His work is characterized by an unusual combination of deep originality and surprising simplicity. He is probably best known for his contributions to the bargaining problem and, more recently, to bounded rationality.","Fellows of the Econometric Society Ariel Rubinstein Economic theories Microeconomics Economics Bounded rationality"

Yet since the 1980s, most central banks have abandoned money-growth targets as practical guidelines for monetary policy as well. How then can pure """"fiat"""" currencies be managed so as to create confidence in the stability of national units of account? Interest and Prices seeks to provide theoretical foundations for a rule-based approach to monetary policy suitable for a world of instant communications and ever more efficient financial markets. In such a world, effective monetary policy requires that central banks construct a conscious and articulate account of what they are doing. Michael Woodford reexamines the foundations of monetary economics, and shows how interest-rate policy can be used to achieve an inflation target in the absence of either commodity backing or control of a monetary aggregate. The book further shows how the tools of modern macroeconomic theory can be used to design an optimal inflation-targeting regime--one that balances stabilization goals with the pursuit of price stability in a way that is grounded in an explicit welfare analysis, and that takes account of the """"New Classical"""" critique of traditional policy evaluation exercises. It thus argues that rule-based policymaking need not mean adherence to a rigid framework unrelated to stabilization objectives for the sake of credibility, while at the same time showing the advantages of rule-based over purely discretionary policymaking.""","Macroeconomic policy Public finance Monetary policy Central banks Fellows of the Econometric Society Inflation targeting Monetary economics Inflation Michael Woodford Proof"

Although Adam Smith amply confirmed this more than two hundred years ago in his analysis of sharecropping contracts, only in recent decades has a theory begun to emerge to place the topic at the heart of economic thinking. In this book, Jean-Jacques Laffont and David Martimort present the most thorough yet accessible introduction to incentives theory to date. Central to this theory is a simple question as pivotal to modern-day management as it is to economics research: What makes people act in a particular way in an economic or business situation? In seeking an answer, the authors provide the methodological tools to design institutions that can ensure good incentives for economic agents. This book focuses on the principal-agent model, the """"simple"""" situation where a principal, or company, delegates a task to a single agent through a contract--the essence of management and contract theory. How does the owner or manager of a firm align the objectives of its various members to maximize profits? Following a brief historical overview showing how the problem of incentives has come to the fore in the past two centuries, the authors devote the bulk of their work to exploring principal-agent models and various extensions thereof in light of three types of information problems: adverse selection, moral hazard, and non-verifiability. Offering an unprecedented look at a subject vital to industrial organization, labor economics, and behavioral economics, this book is set to become the definitive resource for students, researchers, and others who might find themselves pondering what contracts, and the incentives they embody, are really all about.""","Asymmetric information Market failure Economic theories Law and economics Game theory Moral hazard Incentive Mechanism design Economics Information asymmetry Contract theory Complete contract"

Peter Diamond and Hannu Vartiainen's Behavioral Economics and Its Applications argues that behavioral economics can have a similar impact in other fields of economics. In this volume, some of the world's leading thinkers in behavioral economics and general economic theory make the case for a much greater use of behavioral ideas in six fields where these ideas have already proved useful but have not yet been fully incorporated--public economics, development, law and economics, health, wage determination, and organizational economics. The result is an attempt to set the agenda of an important development in economics--an agenda that will interest policymakers, sociologists, and psychologists as well as economists.","Behavioral finance Economic theories Applied psychology Financial economics Social psychology Behavioral economics Economics Eldar Shafir Applied economics Health economics Experimental economics"

The asset pricing results are based on the three increasingly restrictive assumptions: absence of arbitrage, single-agent optimality, and equilibrium. These results are unified with two key concepts, state prices and martingales. Technicalities are given relatively little emphasis, so as to draw connections between these concepts and to make plain the similarities between discrete and continuous-time models. Readers will be particularly intrigued by this latest edition's most significant new feature: a chapter on corporate securities that offers alternative approaches to the valuation of corporate debt. Also, while much of the continuous-time portion of the theory is based on Brownian motion, this third edition introduces jumps--for example, those associated with Poisson arrivals--in order to accommodate surprise events such as bond defaults. Applications include term-structure models, derivative valuation, and hedging methods. Numerical methods covered include Monte Carlo simulation and finite-difference solutions for partial differential equations. Each chapter provides extensive problem exercises and notes to the literature. A system of appendixes reviews the necessary mathematical concepts. And references have been updated throughout.

Less noted was Shiller's admonition that our infatuation with the stock market distracts us from more durable economic prospects. These lie in the hidden potential of real assets, such as income from our livelihoods and homes. But these ''ordinary riches,'' so fundamental to our well-being, are increasingly exposed to the pervasive risks of a rapidly changing global economy. This compelling and important new book presents a fresh vision for hedging risk and securing our economic future. Shiller describes six fundamental ideas for using modern information technology and advanced financial theory to temper basic risks that have been ignored by risk management institutions--risks to the value of our jobs and our homes, to the vitality of our communities, and to the very stability of national economies. Informed by a comprehensive risk information database, this new financial order would include global markets for trading risks and exploiting myriad new financial opportunities, from inequality insurance to intergenerational social security. Just as developments in insuring risks to life, health, and catastrophe have given us a quality of life unimaginable a century ago, so Shiller's plan for securing crucial assets promises to substantially enrich our condition. Once again providing an enormous service, Shiller gives us a powerful means to convert our ordinary riches into a level of economic security, equity, and growth never before seen.

Some 40 percent of new executives don't last 18 months. Why do so many employees with strong track records derail when promoted to the executive suite? In The Next Level, Scott Eblin draws on 20 years of experience as a leader and executive coach to identify why new executives fail—and offers a practical program for achieving success. Rising executives must understand that the strengths and actions that drove their career progress at lower levels—such as technical prowess—will not necessarily sustain their success as executives. They need to adopt new behaviors and beliefs, and, more important, let go of old ones. Eblin identifies nine sets of opposing behaviors that can make or break new executives and describes how to handle them. To illustrate his points, he interviews 30 accomplished senior executives who offer candid, mentoring stories about breaking into the executive ranks and what worked and didn't work for them. Beyond this tactical advice, Eblin provides a framework for transformational behavior and thinking—for creating executive presence, the confidence that is critical for success. The book concludes with a process for readers who want to identify their highest-priority development opportunities and work to improve their executive-level potential. The Next Level is essential for corporate leaders who have just been promoted to or are on track for the executive level, as well as for leadership development specialists and coaches.","Social psychology Industrial and organizational psychology Leadership Political philosophy Strategic management"

Traditional strategies focus on logic, rational analysis, and game theory, minimizing the emotional aspects of negotiated interactions. Now Lacey Smith takes a fresh perspective. Emotions, he argues, can be harnessed to enable successful negotiation—and the results are always better for both parties. Get It! Street-Smart Negotiation at Work examines the emotions that are part of all decision making, emphasizing the importance of recognizing real motivations behind stated positions. This requires a combination of skills—asking the right questions, building a rapport with the other party, and understanding their true interests, as well as your own.

The author examines the roles of clearing houses, central counterparties, central securities depositories and the custodians, as well as, assessing the impact on the workflow and procedures in the operations function at banks, brokers and institutions. The changes that are taking place in the industry are explored and the impact for operations managers and supervisors assessed. Clearing, settlement and custody is at the heart of everything that happens in the financial markets.   The evolution of clearing and settlement is one that is still happening and as such, it is impacting on the operations function through both new practices but also, increasingly, in terms of regulation, risk and reputation. In essence the efficient clearing and settlement operation is managing risk, not because it is a direct part of the process but more because it is a bi-product. The routine procedures relate to reconciliation and record keeping. If these are performed efficiently and accurately it will result in accurate records of activity and profit and loss.   The settlement process is a key element in identifying and correcting errors made by dealers and traders. Failure to identify the error or act promptly will result in potentially serious financial loss, as well as worrying audit and the regulators. In addition to these concerns the financial service sector is also undergoing a massive rationalization of the structure of clearing and settlement and seeking the twin goals of automation and shortening settlement cycles. The challenge for operations managers is considerable: manage costs, eradicate inefficiencies, create an environment to be competitive, and implement the procedures to meet future changes that will occur.   In this book the author looks at some of the different roles, the processes and procedures, and the key issues, in order to help those in operations meet the challenge.","Systemic risk Financial markets Payment systems Stock market Clearing Settlement Central securities depository ACT Central Counterparty Clearing Code of Conduct for Clearing and Settlement"

A complete practical reference book covering all aspects of financial risk management including an in-depth look at operational risk management, regulation, risk-based capital, and risk adjusted performance measurement. The book focuses on practical financial risk management techniques and solutions, and is designed to guide the risk professional step-by-step through the implementation of a firm-wide risk management framework. This book covers the various roles of the risk management function. Rather than describing every possible role in exhaustive detail, the authors have provided a story line for each of the discussed topics, including practical issues that a risk manager needs to consider when tackling the subject, possible solutions to difficulties that might be encountered, background knowledge that is essential to know, and more intricate practices and techniques that are being used. By providing these fundamentals, the novice risk professional can gain a thorough understanding of the topic in question while the more experienced professional can use some of the more advanced concepts within the book. Thus the book can be used to broaden your own knowledge of the risk world, both by familiarizing yourself with areas in which you lack experience and by enhancing your knowledge in areas that you already have expertise. All authors are leaders in their field who between them have the expertise and knowledge, both practical and theoretical, to produce this definitive risk management guide. The editors of this book, Marc Lore and Lev Borodovsky, are senior financial risk managers at Sanwa Bank (International) London, and Credit Suisse First Boston, USA respectively. They also run The Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP), the industry association for financial risk management practitioners and researchers.","Actuarial science Risk management Financial risk Risk Security Financial risk management Financial Risk Manager Enterprise risk management Operational risk Credit risk IT risk management Value at risk"

The relationship between the trading and dealing functions and the operations functions is examined and the issues discussed. This book looks at the financial markets from the viewpoint of the person working in the operations functions that support the trading, dealing and investment processes, and as such is essential reading in order to fully understand the industry - an industry which has gone, and is still going through, much change. As the markets undergo change so too do the administration, clearing and settlement functions, as the clearing houses, securities depositories and custodians merge and diversify. This is going to impact on the operations teams that support the trading, sales and retail business. A failure to be aware of and to understand the impact of changes in the markets will create massive problems, greater risk and ultimately financial losses. And yet the sheer size and diversity of the global markets, together with the rapid pace of change and expansion, and the increasing volume of transactions needing to be processed, presents a massive challenge to operations teams and managers. Knowing how the markets work and what impacts on the operations team is crucial for managers and supervisors. In this book the author provides a full explanation of the markets and their impact in operations terms. So if you are about to embark on a career in operations 'Understanding the Markets' is essential reading. Alternatively, if you are planning a career as a dealer it will prove very useful in explaining the process that occurs after you have traded.","Financial markets Systemic risk Clearing Derivative Security Commodity market Securities market Mark Mobius"

This activity took place in various environments; it always led to reflect on the content of macroeconomic knowledge, as well as on research methods for improving or applying knowledge; it called for continually reading the literature, often marvelling at new ideas or research innovations, sometimes also annoyed at misplaced claims or risky fashions, always wondering how recent results were progressively enriching or altering earlier accumulated knowledge.  Such a long maturation inevitably entails a perspective in which contributions made in the 1950s and 1960s find their place beside more modern ones, even when the latter may claim to encompass some of the former. But the book is not about the various macroeconomic schools, nor about the history of macroeconomic ideas. It rather aims at offering an organized treatment of present knowledge, occasionally exposing the contributions of famous authors or famous works, but only when that seemed to be unavoidable.  The book is addressed mainly to students who are already acquainted with economics and its methods. No prerequisite is absolutely required; but the text is too dense for being directly accessible to those who would be ignorant of economic concepts, of economic phenomena or of the economics discipline. The author hopes that the book will be used in the first years of post-graduate teaching. Also that it will serve as a reference on particular macroeconomic issues of unfamiliar approaches to varying economists.  Volumes A and B are simultaneously published, in advance of Volume C. These Volumes A and B already make a self-contained book, fully adequate for teaching a one-year course. Students will occasionally read references to short-run dynamics and to material contained in chapters 8 or 9; but knowing these references is never required for understanding the text where they occur.","Economic theories New classical macroeconomics Unemployment Macroeconomic policy Macroeconomics Macroeconomic model Rational expectations Adaptive expectations Inflation NAIRU Keynesian economics Monetary policy"

In the 1950s, who but the most rampant optimist would have dreamt that over the next fifty years the real return on equities would be 9% per year? Yet this is what happened in the U.S. stock market. The optimists triumphed. However, as Don Marquis observed, an optimist is someone who never had much experience. The authors of this book extend our experience across regions and across time. They present a comprehensive and consistent analysis of investment returns for equities, bonds, bills, currencies and inflation, spanning sixteen countries, from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first. This is achieved in a clear and simple way, with over 130 color diagrams that make comparison easy.Crucially, the authors analyze total returns, including reinvested income. They show that some historical indexes overstate long-term performance because they are contaminated by survivorship bias and that long-term stock returns are in most countries seriously overestimated, due to a focus on periods that with hindsight are known to have been successful.The book also provides the first comprehensive evidence on the long-term equity risk premium--the reward for bearing the risk of common stocks. The authors reveal whether the United States and United Kingdom have had unusually high stock market returns compared to other countries. The book covers the U.S., the U.K., Japan, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark, and South Africa.Triumph of the Optimists is required reading for investment professionals, financial economists, and investors.

Why did the Industrial Revolution--and the unprecedented economic growth that came with it--occur in eighteenth-century England, and not at some other time, or in some other place? Why didn't industrialization make the whole world rich--and why did it make large parts of the world even poorer? In A Farewell to Alms, Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a new and provocative way in which culture--not exploitation, geography, or resources--explains the wealth, and the poverty, of nations.  Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable political, legal, and economic institutions in seventeenth-century Europe, Clark shows that such institutions existed long before industrialization. He argues instead that these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by encouraging people to abandon hunter-gatherer instincts-violence, impatience, and economy of effort-and adopt economic habits-hard work, rationality, and education.  The problem, Clark says, is that only societies that have long histories of settlement and security seem to develop the cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable economic growth. For the many societies that have not enjoyed long periods of stability, industrialization has not been a blessing. Clark also dissects the notion, championed by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, that natural endowments such as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations.  A brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies can be economically developed through outside intervention, A Farewell to Alms may change the way global economic history is understood.","Demographic economics Demography Human geography Economic indicators Socioeconomics Malthusian trap Economic growth Demographic transition Economic inequality Malthusianism Globalization Poverty"

Standard economic theory did not give much credit to the role of networks until the early 1990s, but since then the study of the theory of networks has blossomed. At the heart of this research is the idea that the pattern of connections between individual rational agents shapes their actions and determines their rewards. The importance of connections has in turn motivated the study of the very processes by which networks are formed.  In Connections, Sanjeev Goyal puts contemporary thinking about networks and economic activity into context. He develops a general framework within which this body of research can be located. In the first part of the book he demonstrates that location in a network has significant effects on individual rewards and that, given this, it is natural that individuals will seek to form connections to move the network in their favor. This idea motivates the second part of the book, which develops a general theory of network formation founded on individual incentives.

The intrinsic value of proposed investments should be assessed before deciding how much capital to allocate; the benefits and risks associated with each available source of finance should be considered when capital is being raised; and capital, and any associated financial risks, should be managed in a way that continues to maximise value. At every stage, an analysis should be carried out to ensure the decision is optimal for shareholders and other capital providers. This book provides practical guidance on the application of financial evaluation techniques and methods (mainly covered in Appendices), as well as comprehensive coverage of traditional corporate finance topics, discussed in the context of capital investment, raising and management and financial risk management (using derivatives). Models, formulae and other quantitative techniques are illustrated in over 100 examples (using only basic mathematics). Topics discussed include the following:     business appraisal using financial ratios    corporate valuation (mainly discounted cash flow and real options)    investment appraisal techniques    acquisition structuring and evaluation    the nature of loans and loan agreements    features and pricing of bonds (straight and convertible)    leasing (including leveraged leasing)    equity raising (Initial Public Offerings)    long and short term capital management    basic pricing of derivatives (forwards, futures, options, swaps)    interest rate and currency risk management using derivatives     Capital Investment & Financing provides a comprehensive, in-depth coverage of concepts, methods and techniques involved when evaluating acquisitions and other investments, assessing financing opportunities, and managing capital. The core chapters provide practical guidance on key corporate finance topics; the Appendices contain more quantitative material, focusing on pricing techniques. Examples are used throughout, and an integrated case study (fictional) in the final Appendix uses many of the techniques discussed.","Options Mathematical finance Corporate finance Fixed income analysis Pricing Convertible bond Futures contract Derivative Black–Scholes model Interest rate swap Bond Swap"

Considerable emphasis is also given to the key controls and the importance of control functions, audit and risk management groups and policy. Case studies are used to effectively demonstrate 'success' and 'failure'. In the financial services industry risk is a constant threat to organizations of all sizes and to the markets themselves. Many industry 'events' have shown how dangerous it is when a business operates in an uncontrolled way, particularly when the lack of control was not evident to the management of the business until it was too late. Controls, procedures and risk are occupying more and more management time. The responsibility to manage the risks lies with the whole operations team. If it is successful in fulfilling this role the overall risk of the business is reduced, if it is not successful the consequences may be severe. In this book the author has deliberately focussed on the practical side of risk, controls and procedures, rather than analyse the Basel Capital Accord and the capital requirements etc.(however, the Accord and updates are contained in the Appendices). Operations teams need to be aware of risk but not overwhelmed by it. Risk management within, and by, the operations function is the focus of this book. From day-to-day risk to wider risk implications the operations function is reviewed to show the sources and implications of risk situations.","Actuarial science Risk Security Management IT risk management Risk management Operational risk Financial risk Enterprise risk management Entity-level controls"

The most recent wave, the 5th takeover wave of the 1990s, was characterized by an unprecedented number of corporate restructurings in terms of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), public-to-private transactions, spin-offs and divestitures, and leveraged recapitalizations. Following the collapse of the stock market in March 2000, M&A activity slumped dramatically, but this pause ended in the second half of 2004 when takeover deals occurred again quite frequently. Indeed, some observers wonder whether the 6th takeover wave has started. The takeover wave in the 1990s was particularly remarkable in terms of size and geographical dispersion. For the first time, Continental European firms were as eager to participate as their US and UK counterparts, and M&A activity in Europe hit levels similar to those experienced in the US. Due to its financial impact and the unprecedented activity in Continental Europe, the 5th takeover wave of the 1990s and recent takeover activity (in biotech, utilities, pharmaceuticals) have triggered a great deal of interesting academic research. This volume brings together a selection of insightful papers. An impressive group of international authors address the following themes: takeover regulation; the cyclical pattern of the M&A markets and probable causes and effects; methods to determine the performance of success of M&A actions; cross border deals; means of payment and its effects; studies of hostile bids; high leverage takeovers and delistings.","Mergers and acquisitions Corporate finance Takeover Reverse takeover Listing"

As a field, Public Economics is defined by its objectives rather than its techniques and much of what is new is the application of modern methods of economic theory and econometrics to problems that have been addressed by economists for over two hundred years. More generally, the discussion of public finance issues also involves elements of political science, finance and philosophy. These connections are evidence in several of the chapters that follow.  Public Economics is the positive and normative study of government's effect on the economy. We attempt to explain why government behaves as it does, how its behavior influences the behavior of private firms and households, and what the welfare effects of such changes in behavior are. Following Musgrave (1959) one may imagine three purposes for government intervention in the economy: allocation, when market failure causes the private outcome  to be Pareto inefficient, distribution, when the private market outcome leaves some individuals with unacceptably low shares  in the fruits of the economy, and stabilization, when the private market outcome leaves some of the economy's resources underutilized. The recent trend in economic research has tended to emphasize the character of stabilization problems as problems of allocation in the labor market. The effects that government intervention can have on the allocation and distribution of an economy's resources are described in terms of efficiency and incidence effects. These are the primary measures used to evaluate the welfare effects of government policy.","Public finance Optimal tax Taxation Tax Public economics Finance Optimal capital income taxation JEL classification codes"

Commonly referred to as """"market data"""", the universe of content is very wide and the type of information correspondingly diverse. Jargon and acronyms are very common. As a result, users of marker data typically face difficulty in applying the content in analysis and business applications. This guide provides an independent framework for understanding this diversity and streamlining the process of referring to content and how it relates to today's business environment. The book achieves this goal by providing a consistent frame of reference for users of market data. As such, it is built around the concept of a data model – a single, coherent view of the capital markets independent of any one source, such as an exchange. In particular it delineates clearly between the actual data content and how it is delivered (i.e., realtime data streams versus reference data). It shows how the data relates across the universe of securities (i.e., stocks, bonds, derivatives etc.). In this way it provides a logical framework for understanding how new content can be added over time as the business develops. Special features:   Uniqueness – this is the first comprehensive catalog and taxonomy to be made available for a business audience  Industry Acceptance – the framework described in this book is implemented as a relational data model in the industry today and used by blue chip multinational firms  Comprehensiveness – there are no arbitrary distinctions made based on asset class or data type (the legacy approach). The model presented in this book is fully cross asset and makes no distinction between data types (i.e., realtime versus historical/reference data) or sources  Independence – the framework is an independent, objective overview of how the data content integrates to provide a coherent view of the data produced by the global capital markets on a daily and intra-day basis.

This assumes that the decision maker trusts the model completely. But what should a decision maker do if the model cannot be trusted?

By using this theory to let decision makers acknowledge misspecification in economic modeling, the authors develop applications to a variety of problems in dynamic macroeconomics.

Using recent advances in evolutionary game theory, contract theory, behavioral experiments, and the modeling of dynamic processes, he develops a theory of how economic institutions shape individual behavior, and how institutions evolve due to individual actions, technological change, and chance events. Topics addressed include institutional innovation, social preferences, nonmarket social interactions, social capital, equilibrium unemployment, credit constraints, economic power, generalized increasing returns, disequilibrium outcomes, and path dependency.Each chapter is introduced by empirical puzzles or historical episodes illuminated by the modeling that follows, and the book closes with sets of problems to be solved by readers seeking to improve their mathematical modeling skills. Complementing standard mathematical analysis are agent-based computer simulations of complex evolving systems that are available online so that readers can experiment with the models. Bowles concludes with the time-honored challenge of """"getting the rules right,"""" providing an evaluation of markets, states, and communities as contrasting and yet sometimes synergistic structures of governance. Must reading for students and scholars not only in economics but across the behavioral sciences, this engagingly written and compelling exposition of the new microeconomics moves the field beyond the conventional models of prices and markets toward a more accurate and policy-relevant portrayal of human social behavior.""","Economic theories Market Nonmarket forces Production economics Microeconomics Samuel Bowles Economics Institutional economics Capitalism Preference JEL classification codes"

Managing Operational Risk in Financial Markets outlines the major issues for risk management and focuses on operational risk as a key activity in managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis. While risk management had always been an integral part of financial activity, the 1990s has seen the requirement for risk management establish itself as a key function within banks and other financial institutions. With greater emphasis on ensuring that money is not lost through adverse market conditions, counterparty failure or inappropriate controls, systems or people, risk management has become a discipline in its own right. Managing risk is now THE paramount topic within the financial sector. Recurring major losses through the 1990s has shocked financial institutions into placing much greater emphasis on risk management and controls. The collapse of Barings and losses made by Metallgescellschaft, Orange County, Diawa and Sumitomo as a result of a lack of procedures, systems or managerial control has demonstrated to organisations the need to broaden the scope of their risk management activity from merely looking at market and credit risk. This has brought into focus the need for managing operational risk. Operational risk can only be managed on an enterprise wide basis as it includes the entire process of policies, culture, procedures, expertise and systems that an institution needs in order to manage all the risks resulting from its financial transactions. In fact, in order to effectively manage market and credit risks it is necessary to have the relevant skills and expertise in the staff, technical and organisational infrastructure, as well as monitoring and control systems. As all of these are components of operational risk, it then becomes apparent that an integrated risk management approach needs to focus on operational risk.","Risk Actuarial science Security Management Risk management Operational risk Financial risk Enterprise risk management IT risk management"

Economists who have surveyed the field generally locate the origins of contemporary cultural economics as being in 1966, the year of publication of the first major work in modern times dedicated specifically to the economics of the arts. It was a book by Baumol and Bowen which showed that economic analysis could illuminate the supply of and demand for artistic services, the contribution of the arts sector to the economy, and the role of public policy. Following the appearance of the Baumol and Bowen work, interest in the economics of the arts grew steadily, embracing areas such as demand for the arts, the economic functions of artists, the role of the nonprofit sector, and other areas. Cultural economics also expanded to include the cultural or entertainment industries (the media, movies, the publishing industry, popular music), as well as heritage and museum management, property right questions (in particular copyright) and the role of new communication technologies such as the internet. The field is therefore located at the crossroads of several disciplines: economics and management, but also art history, art philosophy, sociology and law. The Handbook is placed firmly in economics, but it also builds bridges across these various disciplines and will thus be of interest to researchers in all these different fields, as well as to those who are engaged in cultural policy issues and the role of culture in the development of our societies.","Cultural economics Information economics Industries Creative industries Creativity Cultural policy Cultural industry William Baumol Economics Market Economics of the arts and literature"

Political Skill at Work is the first thorough examination of an ability that is as subtle as it is powerful. The result of more than 15 years of research, this welldocumented study is rich with examples of individuals using political skill to succeed in the corporate world, government, education, and sports. Combining scholarship with practical advice, the authors explore what political skill is (and isn't), why and how it works, and how it can be measured and developed.   The authors define four key dimensions of political skill: social astuteness, interpersonal influence, networking ability, and apparent sincerity. Their 18-item Political Skill Inventory, which is easily self-administered and scored, measures strength in these areas. Techniques to improve each ability are discussed, along with an arsenal of political tactics that contribute to professional success.   Why is political skill so important in the workplace? The authors uncover the role it plays in getting hired, building a reputation, raising job performance, and enhancing leadership abilities. By increasing selfconfidence and control, it even correlates with reduced job stress. Political skill is a strong predictor of job success.

But focusing on the wrong change can be organizational suicide, resulting in missed opportunities, lost momentum, damaged credibility, and squandered resources. Making Change Happen On Time, On Target, On Budget goes right to the heart of what it takes to thoroughly analyze the change needed, articulate a compelling """"business case for change"""" story, choose an approach that best fits the work culture, and take action to move employees from compliance to commitment.Confronting head-on the prevailing notion that one size fits all, Matejka and Murphy show clearly how each type of change initiative—from continuous improvement to strategic redirection—requires its own style of leadership, a unique communication plan, different levels of staff involvement, and any number of other implementation strategies to overcome roadblocks and ensure successful completion. With best practices from successful change leaders and dozens of Action Tools—including a Tracking Map that summarizes the book's key learnings and a Tracking Planner to reuse for each change launched—this power-packed toolkit digs deep into the details of the authors' six-step change process to show how every leader, manager, and positive change agent can make the right change at the right time with the right leadership.""","Budgets Management"

But this excessive reliance on quantitative precision is misleading--and it puts us all at risk. This is the case that Riccardo Rebonato makes in Plight of the Fortune Tellers--and coming from someone who is both an experienced market professional and an academic, this heresy is worth listening to. Rebonato forcefully argues that we must restore genuine decision making to our financial planning, and he shows us how to do it using probability, experimental psychology, and decision theory. This is the only way to effectively manage financial risk in a manner congruent with how human beings actually react to chance. Rebonato challenges us to rethink the standard wisdom about probability in financial-risk management. Risk managers have become obsessed with measuring risk and believe that these quantitative results by themselves can guide sound financial choices--but they can't. In this book, Rebonato offers a radical yet surprisingly commonsense solution, one that seeks to remind us that managing risk comes down to real people making decisions under uncertainty. Plight of the Fortune Tellers is not only a book for the decision makers of Wall Street, it's a must-read for anyone concerned about how today's financial markets are run.

By presenting basic concepts of economic theory with ideas in modern strategy literature, the book provides an economic lens for viewing the broad sweep of the strategic activities of the firm. The book begins by focusing on the boundaries of the firm and examines competitive strategy from the perspective of industrial organization (IO) economics, particularly Porter's Five Forces. It then explores strategic positioning and dynamics as well as topics associated with internal organization, including personnel economics, organization structure, and strategic fit. Features of the Fourth Edition :  Chapters on human resources management, entry, positioning, dynamics, technological change, and organizational structure are substantially revised.  An updated chapter on business history covers the recent dot-com bubble.  Presents economic principles without overemphasizing the math.  Rigorous treatment of organizational topics such as structure and culture enables you to experience the full scope of strategic thinking.

The text also considers the Value Net, another tool for organizing industry analysis.  Includes coverage of make or buy decisions (Chapters 2-4) and benefit and cost advantage and sustaining advantage (Chapters 11-13).

The author presents the theories of stochastic processes and stochastic calculus and provides the necessary tools for modeling and pricing in finance and insurance. Practical in focus, the book's emphasis is on application, intuition, and computation, rather than theory. Consequently, the text is of interest to graduate students, researchers, and practitioners interested in these areas. While the text is self-contained, an introductory course in probability theory is beneficial to prospective readers. This book evolved from the author's experience as an instructor and has been thoroughly classroom-tested. Following an introduction, the author sets forth the fundamental information and tools needed by researchers and practitioners working in the financial and insurance industries:   Overview of Probability Theory  Discrete-Time stochastic processes  Continuous-time stochastic processes  Stochastic calculus: basic topics   The final two chapters, Stochastic Calculus: Advanced Topics and Applications in Insurance, are devoted to more advanced topics. Readers learn the Feynman-Kac formula, the Girsanov's theorem, and complex barrier hitting times distributions. Finally, readers discover how stochastic analysis and principles are applied in practice through two insurance examples: valuation of equity-linked annuities under a stochastic interest rate environment and calculation of reserves for universal life insurance. Throughout the text, figures and tables are used to help simplify complex theory and pro-cesses. An extensive bibliography opens up additional avenues of research to specialized topics. Ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, this text is recommended for one-semester courses in stochastic finance and calculus. It is also recommended as a study guide for professionals taking Causality Actuarial Society (CAS) and Society of Actuaries (SOA) actuarial examinations.","Stochastic processes Mathematical finance Stochastic calculus Equations Girsanov theorem Stochastic differential equation Economic model Black–Scholes model Stochastic Differential equation Certificate in Quantitative Finance Outline of finance"

It is also the perfect resource for economists who need to brush up on the latest developments.  Michael Wickens lays out the core ideas of modern macroeconomics and its links with finance. He presents the simplest general equilibrium macroeconomic model for a closed economy, and then gradually develops a comprehensive model of the open economy. Every important topic is covered, including growth, business cycles, fiscal policy, taxation and debt finance, current account sustainability, exchange-rate determination, and an up-to-date account of monetary policy through inflation targeting. Wickens addresses the interrelationships between macroeconomics and modern finance and shows how they affect stock, bond, and foreign-exchange markets. While the mathematics needed for this book is rigorous, the author describes fundamental concepts in a way that helps make the book self-contained and easy to use.

This book provides an introduction and overview for readers who seek an up-to-date reference to the central problems of the field and to the tools currently used to analyze them. The book is aimed at researchers and students in finance, at quantitative analysts in banks and other financial institutions, and at regulators interested in the modeling aspects of credit risk. David Lando considers the two broad approaches to credit risk analysis: that based on classical option pricing models on the one hand, and on a direct modeling of the default probability of issuers on the other. He offers insights that can be drawn from each approach and demonstrates that the distinction between the two approaches is not at all clear-cut. The book strikes a fruitful balance between quickly presenting the basic ideas of the models and offering enough detail so readers can derive and implement the models themselves. The discussion of the models and their limitations and five technical appendixes help readers expand and generalize the models themselves or to understand existing generalizations. The book emphasizes models for pricing as well as statistical techniques for estimating their parameters. Applications include rating-based modeling, modeling of dependent defaults, swap- and corporate-yield curve dynamics, credit default swaps, and collateralized debt obligations.","United States housing bubble Credit default swap Systemic risk Fixed income securities Funds Structured finance Mathematical finance Credit risk Derivative Collateralized debt obligation Markov chain Interest rate swap"

A comprehensive introduction, The Econometrics of Individual Risk is the first book to provide a complete econometric methodology for quantifying and managing this underappreciated but important variety of risk. The book presents a course in the econometric theory of individual risk illustrated by empirical examples. And, unlike other texts, it is focused entirely on solving the actual individual risk problems businesses confront today. Christian Gourieroux and Joann Jasiak emphasize the microeconometric aspect of risk analysis by extensively discussing practical problems such as retail credit scoring, credit card transaction dynamics, and profit maximization in promotional mailing. They address regulatory issues in sections on computing the minimum capital reserve for coverage of potential losses, and on the credit-risk measure CreditVar.

Drawing lessons from the failures of four insurance companies, When Insurers Go Bust dramatically advances this debate by arguing that the current approach to insurance regulation should be replaced with mechanisms that replicate the governance of non-financial firms. Rather than immediately addressing the minutiae of supervision, Guillaume Plantin and Jean-Charles Rochet first identify a fundamental economic rationale for supervising the solvency of insurance companies: policyholders are the """"bankers"""" of insurance companies. But because policyholders are too dispersed to effectively monitor insurers, it might be efficient to delegate monitoring to an institution--a prudential authority. Applying recent developments in corporate finance theory and the economic theory of organizations, the authors describe in practical terms how such authorities could be created and given the incentives to behave exactly like bankers behave toward borrowers, as """"tough"""" claimholders.""","Financial institutions Systemic risk Insurance Financial regulation Reinsurance Philippine Prudential Life Insurance Company Swiss Insurance Association"

Indeed, most of the asset returns exhibit “fat-tails” distributions and investors exhibit asymmetric preferences. These empirical findings lead to the development of a new area of research dedicated to the introduction of higher order moments in portfolio theory and asset pricing models.  Multi-moment asset pricing is a revolutionary new way of modeling time series in finance which allows various degrees of long-term memory to be generated. It allows risk and prices of risk to vary through time enabling the accurate valuation of long-lived assets. This book presents the state-of-the art in multi-moment asset allocation and pricing models and provides many new developments in a single volume, collecting in a unified framework theoretical results and applications previously scattered throughout the financial literature. The topics covered in this comprehensive volume include: four-moment individual risk preferences, mathematics of the multi-moment efficient frontier, coherent asymmetric risks measures, hedge funds asset allocation under higher moments, time-varying specifications of (co)moments and multi-moment asset pricing models with homogeneous and heterogeneous agents.

It's being used more and more frequently—and more successfully—on a wide variety of high-profile corporate projects, and has long been used to fund large-scale natural resource projects, from pipelines and refineries to electric-generating facilities and hydroelectric projects. But the challenges of successful project financing are immense, and the requirements of the process can easily be misunderstood. This newly updated edition of Project Financing takes you through the process step by step. Using actual examples and case studies—including Euro Disneyland and the Eurotunnel Project—that illustrate how to apply the analytical techniques described in the book, it covers the rationale for project financing, how to prepare the financial plan, assess the risks, design the financing mix, and raise the funds. John Finnerty draws on his vast experience in the field to detail each step of the process, describing the circumstances in which it is most likely to be advantageous, how to craft contractual arrangements to allocate risks and rewards among the interested parties, and how to deal with government, legal, tax, and financial issues. Finnerty has fully revised his original classic work to include up-to-date material on the rationale for project financing, assessing risk, security arrangements, legal structure and contract options, preparing the financial plan, estimating the borrowing capacity of a project, legal requirements, and much more. In addition, he has added completely new chapters that cover the role of financial institutions that finance large projects, analytical tools that are increasingly useful in capital budgeting, and techniques for hedging project risks. His latest research draws from the work of renowned Harvard researcher Benjamin C. Esty and illustrates in detail why some project financing plans have succeeded while others have failed. For corporate finance professionals, CFO's, financial analysts, project planners, and private investors, Project Financing, Second Edition demystifies the complexities of project financing and provides an invaluable guide for anyone who wants to master innovation in corporate finance today.","Corporate finance Finance Public–private partnership Financial modeling Premium Financing Project finance"

While economic globalization can be a boon for countries that are trying to dig out of poverty, success usually requires following policies that are tailored to local economic and political realities rather than obeying the dictates of the international globalization establishment. A definitive statement of Rodrik's original and influential perspective on economic growth and globalization, One Economics, Many Recipes shows how successful countries craft their own unique strategies--and what other countries can learn from them. To most proglobalizers, globalization is a source of economic salvation for developing nations, and to fully benefit from it nations must follow a universal set of rules designed by organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization and enforced by international investors and capital markets. But to most antiglobalizers, such global rules spell nothing but trouble, and the more poor nations shield themselves from them, the better off they are. Rodrik rejects the simplifications of both sides, showing that poor countries get rich not by copying what Washington technocrats preach or what others have done, but by overcoming their own highly specific constraints. And, far from conflicting with economic science, this is exactly what good economics teaches.","World government International trade Cultural geography Economic geography Dani Rodrik Economic globalization Globalization Development economics Global governance Outline of globalization Concertina model"

Stephen Ross developed the no arbitrage principle, tying asset pricing to the simple proposition that there are no free lunches in financial markets, and jointly with John Cox he developed the related concept of risk-neutral pricing. In this book Ross makes a strong case that these concepts are the fundamental pillars of modern finance and, in particular, of market efficiency. In an efficient market prices reflect the information possessed by the market and, as a consequence, trading schemes using commonly available information to beat the market are doomed to fail. By stark contrast, the currently popular stance offered by behavioral finance, fueled by a number of apparent anomalies in the financial markets, regards market prices as subject to the psychological whims of investors. But without any appeal to psychology, Ross shows that neoclassical theory provides a simple and rich explanation that resolves many of the anomalies on which behavioral finance has been fixated. Based on the inaugural Princeton Lectures in Finance, sponsored by the Bendheim Center for Finance of Princeton University, this elegant book represents a major contribution to the ongoing debate on market efficiency, and serves as a useful primer on the fundamentals of finance for both scholars and practitioners.","Financial economics Financial markets Behavioral finance Mathematical finance Market trends Stephen Ross Finance Efficient-market hypothesis Arbitrage Behavioral economics Corporate finance Capital asset pricing model"

But until now asset-price analysis has largely been inaccessible to everyone except PhDs in financial economics. In this book, Sharpe changes that by setting out his state-of-the-art approach to asset pricing in a nonmathematical form that will be comprehensible to a broad range of investment professionals, including investment advisors, money managers, and financial analysts. Bridging the gap between the best financial theory and investment practice, Investors and Markets will help investment professionals make better portfolio choices by being smarter about asset prices. Based on Sharpe's Princeton Lectures in Finance, Investors and Markets presents a method of analyzing asset prices that accounts for the real behavior of investors. Sharpe makes this technique accessible through a new, one-of-a-kind computer program (available for free on his Web site, at http://www.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/apsim/index.html) that enables users to create virtual markets, setting the starting conditions and then allowing trading until equilibrium is reached and trading stops. Program users can then analyze the final portfolios and asset prices, see expected returns, and measure risk. In addition to popularizing the most sophisticated form of asset-price analysis, Investors and Markets summarizes much of Sharpe's most important previous work and reflects a lifetime of thinking about investing by one of the leading minds in financial economics.

Samuelson Award for scholarly writing on lifelong financial security, John Cochrane's Asset Pricing now appears in a revised edition that unifies and brings the science of asset pricing up to date for advanced students and professionals. Cochrane traces the pricing of all assets back to a single idea--price equals expected discounted payoff--that captures the macro-economic risks underlying each security's value. By using a single, stochastic discount factor rather than a separate set of tricks for each asset class, Cochrane builds a unified account of modern asset pricing. He presents applications to stocks, bonds, and options. Each model--consumption based, CAPM, multifactor, term structure, and option pricing--is derived as a different specification of the discounted factor. The discount factor framework also leads to a state-space geometry for mean-variance frontiers and asset pricing models. It puts payoffs in different states of nature on the axes rather than mean and variance of return, leading to a new and conveniently linear geometrical representation of asset pricing ideas. Cochrane approaches empirical work with the Generalized Method of Moments, which studies sample average prices and discounted payoffs to determine whether price does equal expected discounted payoff. He translates between the discount factor, GMM, and state-space language and the beta, mean-variance, and regression language common in empirical work and earlier theory. The book also includes a review of recent empirical work on return predictability, value and other puzzles in the cross section, and equity premium puzzles and their resolution. Written to be a summary for academics and professionals as well as a textbook, this book condenses and advances recent scholarship in financial economics.","Mathematical finance Financial economics Beta Intertemporal CAPM Stochastic discount factor Discounting Black–Scholes model Variance Arbitrage pricing theory Capital asset pricing model"

In this unconventional book, Nielsen calls for an end to """"rank-based"""" organizational structures, which foster secrecy and miscommunication, and steal the joy from work, while breeding corruption and abuse of power. Nielsen's new model is the """"peer-based"""" organization, which uses rotating peer leadership councils and crossfunctional task forces to manage the organization's work. These new entities are better suited to making decisions based on the organization's competencies and customer needs, rather than on static functional groups or other artificial divisions.

Gen X women are especially frustrated. Successors to a generation of feminists who fought for equal opportunity, these young women expected to reap the benefits of their mothers’ struggles—only to find that not much has changed. Disillusioned, many have chosen to leave the professional workforce. If this """"opt out"""" trend continues, the corporate world will lose an invaluable pool of talent, just when retiring Boomers will trigger a labor shortfall. Worse, Gen Xers will lose the chance to take their place as tomorrow’s leaders. In this perceptive study, Charlotte and Laura Shelton, a Boomer mother and Gen X daughter, examine the roots of this frustration—in part, the feminist revolution—and what it will take to change frustration to transformation. In the first half of the book, the authors use surveys with more than 1,200 Gen Xers and interviews with many others to create a multidimensional portrait of this generation at work. Personal stories are interwoven with analysis to reveal how Gen Xers experience work, how Boomer workplace attitudes clash with Xer expectations, and how men and women differ in what they want from their careers. The second half of the book is a call to action, encouraging Gen X women to carry on the revolution their mothers started. A four-point plan shows Gen Xers how to change from victims to activists and take charge of creating a satisfying work environment. Examples of successful X-friendly companies demonstrate how Boomer employers can attract and retain Xer talent. Finally, the authors discuss seven quantum life skills offering both generations an opportunity for personal growth. The NeXt Revolution will benefit Xers and Boomers of both genders and the corporate world they share as it leads to a new understanding of the meaning of work and workplace possibilities.""","Demographics Generation Boomer Strauss–Howe generational theory"

The first several chapters provide an in-depth treatment of the econometric methods used in analyzing financial time-series models. The remainder explores the goodness-of-fit of preference-based and no-arbitrage models of equity returns and the term structure of interest rates; equity and fixed-income derivatives prices; and the prices of defaultable securities. Singleton addresses the restrictions on the joint distributions of asset returns and other economic variables implied by dynamic asset pricing models, as well as the interplay between model formulation and the choice of econometric estimation strategy. For each pricing problem, he provides a comprehensive overview of the empirical evidence on goodness-of-fit, with tables and graphs that facilitate critical assessment of the current state of the relevant literatures. As an added feature, Singleton includes throughout the book interesting tidbits of new research. These range from empirical results (not reported elsewhere, or updated from Singleton's previous papers) to new observations about model specification and new econometric methods for testing models.

Whether liability litigation for pharmaceutical firms or an individual's having insufficient wealth to retire, risk is something that can be recognized, quantified, analyzed, treated--and incorporated into our decision-making processes. This book represents a concise summary of basic multiperiod decision-making under risk. Its detailed coverage of a broad range of topics is ideally suited for use in advanced undergraduate and introductory graduate courses either as a self-contained text, or the introductory chapters combined with a selection of later chapters can represent core reading in courses on macroeconomics, insurance, portfolio choice, or asset pricing. The authors start with the fundamentals of risk measurement and risk aversion. They then apply these concepts to insurance decisions and portfolio choice in a one-period model. After examining these decisions in their one-period setting, they devote most of the book to a multiperiod context, which adds the long-term perspective most risk management analyses require. Each chapter concludes with a discussion of the relevant literature and a set of problems.

Exploring the cultural nuances that inform the Hispanic experience, HR and the New Hispanic Workforce details what it takes to incorporate the values and sensibilities Hispanic employees bring to the workplace that are so often at odds with those of traditional corporate America. Combining their original research with best-practices examples—from Citigroup Foundation’s internship program to Procter & Gamble’s success creating a Hispanic-friendly workplace—the authors lay out a road map for attracting the best Hispanic candidates, effectively evaluating their performance, and cultivating and retaining their talents. Numerous checklists, questionnaires, sample interview questions, HR guidelines (some in both English and Spanish), and detailed summaries of key lessons at the end of each chapter offer powerful tools for finding new ways to address the increasing use of Spanish in the workplace and effectively reaching into Hispanic communities to uncover and recruit talent.","Workplace"

In this trenchant book, best-selling economist Robert Shiller reveals the origins of this crisis and puts forward bold measures to solve it. He calls for an aggressive response--a restructuring of the institutional foundations of the financial system that will not only allow people once again to buy and sell homes with confidence, but will create the conditions for greater prosperity in America and throughout the deeply interconnected world economy. Shiller blames the subprime crisis on the irrational exuberance that drove the economy's two most recent bubbles--in stocks in the 1990s and in housing between 2000 and 2007. He shows how these bubbles led to the dangerous overextension of credit now resulting in foreclosures, bankruptcies, and write-offs, as well as a global credit crunch. To restore confidence in the markets, Shiller argues, bailouts are needed in the short run. But he insists that these bailouts must be targeted at low-income victims of subprime deals. In the longer term, the subprime solution will require leaders to revamp the financial framework by deploying an ambitious package of initiatives to inhibit the formation of bubbles and limit risks, including better financial information; simplified legal contracts and regulations; expanded markets for managing risks; home equity insurance policies; income-linked home loans; and new measures to protect consumers against hidden inflationary effects.

But today, most corporations are obsessed with maximizing their stock prices, resulting in short-term thinking and the kind of cook-the-books corruption seen in the Enron and WorldCom scandals. How did this happen? In this groundbreaking book, Lawrence E. Mitchell traces the origins of the problem to the first decade of the 20th century, when industrialists and bankers began merging existing companies into huge “combines”—today’s giant corporations—so they could profit by manufacturing and selling stock in these new entities. He describes and analyzes the legal changes that made this possible, the federal regulatory efforts that missed the significance of this transforming development, and the changes in American society and culture that led more and more Americans to enter the market, turning from relatively safe bonds to riskier common stock in the hopes of becoming rich. Financiers and the corporations they controlled encouraged this trend, but as stock ownership expanded and businesses were increasingly forced to cater to stockholders’ “get rich quick” expectations, a subtle but revolutionary shift in the nature of the American economy occurred: finance no longer served industry; instead, industry began to serve finance.

Citing a wide range of research in organizational development and psychology as well as real-world examples, Cameron shows that to go from successful to exceptional, leaders must learn how to create a profoundly positive environment in the workplace. They must build on strengths rather than simply focus on weaknesses; foster positive emotions like compassion, optimism, gratitude, and forgiveness; encourage mutually supportive relationships at all levels; and provide employees with a deep sense of meaning and purpose. In this concise, inspiring, and practical guide, Cameron describes four specific positive leadership strategies, lays out a proven process for implementing them, and includes a self-assessment instrument and a guide to assist leaders in the implementation process.","Industrial and organizational psychology Social psychology Political philosophy Virtue Emotions Leadership Compassion"

This fast-evolving environment presents econometricians with the challenge of forecasting dynamic correlations, which are essential inputs to risk measurement, portfolio allocation, derivative pricing, and many other critical financial activities. In Anticipating Correlations, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Engle introduces an important new method for estimating correlations for large systems of assets: Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC).  	Engle demonstrates the role of correlations in financial decision making, and addresses the economic underpinnings and theoretical properties of correlations and their relation to other measures of dependence. He compares DCC with other correlation estimators such as historical correlation, exponential smoothing, and multivariate GARCH, and he presents a range of important applications of DCC. Engle presents the asymmetric model and illustrates it using a multicountry equity and bond return model. He introduces the new FACTOR DCC model that blends factor models with the DCC to produce a model with the best features of both, and illustrates it using an array of U.S. large-cap equities. Engle shows how overinvestment in collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, lies at the heart of the subprime mortgage crisis--and how the correlation models in this book could have foreseen the risks. A technical chapter of econometric results also is included.  	Based on the Econometric Institute Lectures at Erasmus University Rotterdam, Anticipating Correlations puts powerful new forecasting tools into the hands of researchers, financial analysts, risk managers, derivative quants, and graduate students.","Independence Time series analysis Econometrics Actuarial science Multivariate statistics Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity Correlation Financial risk Robert F.

In this book, Didier Sornette boldly applies his varied experience in these areas to propose a simple, powerful, and general theory of how, why, and when stock markets crash. Most attempts to explain market failures seek to pinpoint triggering mechanisms that occur hours, days, or weeks before the collapse. Sornette proposes a radically different view: the underlying cause can be sought months and even years before the abrupt, catastrophic event in the build-up of cooperative speculation, which often translates into an accelerating rise of the market price, otherwise known as a """"bubble."""" Anchoring his sophisticated, step-by-step analysis in leading-edge physical and statistical modeling techniques, he unearths remarkable insights and some predictions--among them, that the """"end of the growth era"""" will occur around 2050. Sornette probes major historical precedents, from the decades-long """"tulip mania"""" in the Netherlands that wilted suddenly in 1637 to the South Sea Bubble that ended with the first huge market crash in England in 1720, to the Great Crash of October 1929 and Black Monday in 1987, to cite just a few.

Like Keynes, Akerlof and Shiller know that managing these animal spirits requires the steady hand of government--simply allowing markets to work won't do it. In rebuilding the case for a more robust, behaviorally informed Keynesianism, they detail the most pervasive effects of animal spirits in contemporary economic life--such as confidence, fear, bad faith, corruption, a concern for fairness, and the stories we tell ourselves about our economic fortunes--and show how Reaganomics, Thatcherism, and the rational expectations revolution failed to account for them.

But the heart of the problem is that the education-to-employment system worldwide is badly outmoded. We’re not producing graduates with the kinds of technical, communications, and thinking skills needed in the 21st century.  	In Winning the Global Talent Showdown, Ed Gordon surveys the sorry state of the world talent pipeline, with separate chapters on the Americas, Asia, and Europe.

But this is fundamentally a book about solutions. Gordon argues that we need to completely reinvent our talent-creation system—and some pioneering efforts are already underway. He describes dozens of “gateways to the future,” innovative partnerships in which local governments, schools, businesses, labor unions, parents, training organizations, community activists, and others are collaborating to develop completely new approaches to education.

Rejecting the one-size-fits-all premise that underlies so many guides to business strategy, Preston McAfee develops the intellectual tools and insights needed to confront many marketplace problems. Drawing on his broad experience as a consultant for major U.S. companies, as well as extensive research, McAfee emphasizes cooperation, pricing, litigation, and antitrust as vital to a firm's competitive posture--and focuses more attention on these elements than do most business strategy accounts.McAfee begins by considering strategy as successfully applied by America OnLine, an example that introduces many of the tools discussed in greater depth throughout the book. From here he moves to industry analysis: By examining the context for developing a strategy, he points out uses of positioning and differentiation that enable a firm to weaken price competition and deter rivals from stealing customers. McAfee's exploration of a product's life cycle proves an invaluable guide to positioning new technology in order to maximize the potential for future customers.In the centerpiece of the book, McAfee lays out a how-to manual for cooperation, providing tactics crucial for setting standards, lobbying the government, and fostering industry growth. Writing in a conversational manner, McAfee also addresses such deep topics as organizational design and employee compensation and incentives. More detailed discussions examine antitrust enforcement, which is an increasingly important constraint on strategy, as well as strategies for pricing, bidding, signaling, and bargaining.This book is a fascinating examination of modern business strategy and its application in many different settings. Students of business and economics--as well as executives and managers--will recognize Competitive Solutions as an indispensable resource as well as a definitive vision of the strategic firm: one in which each element of company strategy reinforces the other elements.","Marketing Pricing Imperfect competition Monopoly Competition Preston McAfee Strategic management Price discrimination Barriers to entry"

In such auctions the value of each item is about the same to all bidders, but different bidders have different information about the underlying value. Virtually all auctions have a common value element; among the burgeoning modern-day examples are those organized by Internet companies such as eBay. Winners end up cursing when they realize that they won because their estimates were overly optimistic, which led them to bid too much and lose money as a result. The authors first unveil a fresh survey of experimental data on the winner's curse. Melding theory with the econometric analysis of field data, they assess the design of government auctions, such as the spectrum rights (air wave) auctions that continue to be conducted around the world. The remaining chapters gauge the impact on sellers' revenue of the type of auction used and of inside information, show how bidders learn to avoid the winner's curse, and present comparisons of sophisticated bidders with college sophomores, the usual guinea pigs used in laboratory experiments. Appendixes refine theoretical arguments and, in some cases, present entirely new data.

Douglass North inspired a revolution in economic history a generation ago by demonstrating that economic performance is determined largely by the kind and quality of institutions that support markets. As he showed in two now classic books that inspired the New Institutional Economics (today a subfield of economics), property rights and transaction costs are fundamental determinants. Here, North explains how different societies arrive at the institutional infrastructure that greatly determines their economic trajectories.  North argues that economic change depends largely on """"adaptive efficiency,"""" a society's effectiveness in creating institutions that are productive, stable, fair, and broadly accepted--and, importantly, flexible enough to be changed or replaced in response to political and economic feedback. While adhering to his earlier definition of institutions as the formal and informal rules that constrain human economic behavior, he extends his analysis to explore the deeper determinants of how these rules evolve and how economies change. Drawing on recent work by psychologists, he identifies intentionality as the crucial variable and proceeds to demonstrate how intentionality emerges as the product of social learning and how it then shapes the economy's institutional foundations and thus its capacity to adapt to changing circumstances.  Understanding the Process of Economic Change accounts not only for past institutional change but also for the diverse performance of present-day economies. This major work is therefore also an essential guide to improving the performance of developing countries.""","Economic theories Douglass North Social institutions Economics Institution"

This important new text offers a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of economic sociology. It also advances the field theoretically by highlighting, in one analysis, the crucial economic roles of both interests and social relations. Richard Swedberg describes the field's critical insights into economic life, giving particular attention to the effects of culture on economic phenomena and the ways that economic actions are embedded in social structures. He examines the full range of economic institutions and explicates the relationship of the economy to politics, law, culture, and gender. Swedberg notes that sociologists too often fail to properly emphasize the role that self-interested behavior plays in economic decisions, while economists frequently underestimate the importance of social relations. Thus, he argues that the next major task for economic sociology is to develop a theoretical and empirical understanding of how interests and social relations work in combination to affect economic action. Written by an author whose name is synonymous with economic sociology, this text constitutes a sorely needed advanced synthesis--and a blueprint for the future of this burgeoning field.","Subfields of sociology Economic sociology Socioeconomics Sociology Richard Swedberg Reflexivity Guggenheim Fellows European Sociological Association Víctor Nee"

Such reliance is badly misplaced. In Corporate Governance, Jonathan Macey argues that less government regulation--not more--is what's needed to ensure that managers of public companies keep their promises to investors.  Macey tells how heightened government oversight has put a stranglehold on what is the best protection against malfeasance by self-serving management: the market itself. Corporate governance, he shows, is about keeping promises to shareholders; failure to do so results in diminished investor confidence, which leads to capital flight and other dire economic consequences. Macey explains the relationship between corporate governance and the various market and nonmarket institutions and mechanisms used to control public corporations; he discusses how nonmarket corporate governance devices such as boards and whistle-blowers are highly susceptible to being co-opted by management and are generally guided more by self-interest and personal greed than by investor interests. In contrast, market-driven mechanisms such as trading and takeovers represent more reliable solutions to the problem of corporate governance. Inefficient regulations are increasingly hampering these important and truly effective corporate controls. Macey examines a variety of possible means of corporate governance, including shareholder voting, hedge funds, and private equity funds.  Corporate Governance reveals why the market is the best guardian of shareholder interests.","Stock market Corporate governance Corporate law Information governance Management Records management Hedge fund Sarbanes–Oxley Act Governance Insider trading Stock exchange Enron"

Yvan Lengwiler elegantly links together issues that have in the past been the territory of general economic theorists on the one hand, and financial economists on the other.   In a sequence of carefully explained steps, the reader learns how the first welfare theorem is used in asset pricing theory. The book then moves on to explore Radner economies and von Neumann-Morgenstern decision theory, and this section culminates in Wilson's mutuality principle and the consumption-based CAPM. This is then put into a dynamic setting, and term structure models are introduced. The empirical shortcomings of the standard asset pricing models are extensively discussed, as is research from the last twenty years aimed at bringing theory in line with reality. The reader is brought up to date on the latest areas of concern, such as habit formation, the consequences of heterogeneity, demographic effects, changing tax regimes, market frictions, and the implications of prospect theory for asset pricing.  Aimed at masters or Ph.D. students specializing in financial economics, the book can also be used as a supplementary text for students of macroeconomics at this advanced level and will be of interest to finance professionals with a background in economics and mathematics.

But Jennifer Kahnweiler shows that not only can introversion be managed, it can even be a source of strength. Ask Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, two of the leaders she cites as shy introspectives who have developed ways to thrive in a challenging environment.It is estimated that as many as 40 per cent of executives are introverted to at least some extent. Based on conversations with over 100 of these men and women, Kahnweiler lays out a progressive four-step strategy for succeeding in an extroverted world. First, preparation: carefully devise a game plan for any potentially anxiety-producing situation. Then presence: knowing that you’re prepared, be completely focused on the present moment or activity. Next, push: with a firm foundation of preparation and presence, go beyond your comfort zone.  And finally, practice, practice, practice.After a revealing Introverted Leader Quiz to help you deepen your understanding of where focused improvement will produce maximum results, Kahnweiler shows exactly how to apply the four P’s approach in six areas that are particularly difficult for introverts, such as public speaking, heading up projects, participating in meetings, and more.  The goal, she emphasizes, is not personality change—you work with who you are, not against it. In fact, she shows that introversion can actually be a plus in areas like listening skills and written communication. But as a result of reading this book, leaders and aspiring leaders who find it intimidating to be around people will learn to embrace the experience, rather than see it as something to be avoided or endured, and as a result advance their careers and contribute more fully to their organizations.","Personality tests Extraversion and introversion Personal development Popular psychology Self-help books Myers–Briggs Type Indicator Personality Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"

Trade is a cornerstone concept in economics, taught in all departments both in the United States and abroad. The past twenty years have seen a number of new theoretical approaches that are essential to any graduate international trade course, and will be of interest in development economics and other fields. Here, Robert Feenstra steps beyond theory to consider empirical evidence as well. He covers all the basic material including the Ricardian and Hecksher-Ohlin models, extension to many goods and factors, and the role of tariffs, quotas, and other trade policies; recent material including imperfect competition, outsourcing, political economy, multinationals, and endogenous growth; and new material including the gravity equation and the organization of the firm in international trade.  Throughout the book, special emphasis is placed on integrating the theoretical models with empirical evidence, and this is supplemented by theoretical and empirical exercises that appear with each chapter. Advanced International Trade is intended to bring readers to the forefront of knowledge in international trade and prepare them to undertake their own research. Both graduate students and faculty will find a wealth of topics that have previously only been covered in journal articles, and are dealt with here in a common and simple notation. In addition to known results, the book includes some particularly important unpublished results by various authors. Two appendices describe empirical methods applicable to research problems in international trade, methods that draw on (i) index numbers and (ii) discrete choice models. Thoroughly up-to-date and marked by clear, straightforward prose, this book will be used widely--and enthusiastically.","International trade theory International trade Trade Import quota Economics Gravity model of trade Index of international trade topics"

On that day a French doctoral student, Louis Bachelier, successfully defended his thesis Théorie de la Spéculation at the Sorbonne. The jury, while noting that the topic was """"far away from those usually considered by our candidates,"""" appreciated its high degree of originality. This book provides a new translation, with commentary and background, of Bachelier's seminal work.  Bachelier's thesis is a remarkable document on two counts. In mathematical terms Bachelier's achievement was to introduce many of the concepts of what is now known as stochastic analysis. His purpose, however, was to give a theory for the valuation of financial options. He came up with a formula that is both correct on its own terms and surprisingly close to the Nobel Prize-winning solution to the option pricing problem by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973, the first decisive advance since 1900.  Aside from providing an accurate and accessible translation, this book traces the twin-track intellectual history of stochastic analysis and financial economics, starting with Bachelier in 1900 and ending in the 1980s when the theory of option pricing was substantially complete. The story is a curious one. The economic side of Bachelier's work was ignored until its rediscovery by financial economists more than fifty years later. The results were spectacular: within twenty-five years the whole theory was worked out, and a multibillion-dollar global industry of option trading had emerged.""","Louis Bachelier Mathematical finance Option Financial economics Fischer Black Quantitative analyst"

With this hands-on guide, you can find real solutions to real corporate finance problems, using real-time data.  Offering a user perspective to corporate finance, this text poses three major questions that every business has to answer, and provides the tools and the analytical techniques needed to answer these questions.  1. Where do we invest our resources? (The Investment Decision)  The first part of the book shows how to assess risk and develop a risk profile for a firm, and convert this risk profile into a hurdle rate. You'll also learn basic rules for estimating the returns on any investment.  2. How should we fund these investments? (The Financing Decision)  Firms generally can use debt, equity, or some combination of the two to fund projects. This part of the book examines the relationship between this choice and the hurdle rate for analyzing projects, and shows how to use the financing decision to maximize firm value. You'll also find a framework for picking the right kind of security for any firm.  3. How much cash can and should we return to the owners? (The Dividend Decision)  The third part of the book establishes a process for deciding how much cash should be taken out of the business and in what form (dividends or stock buybacks).  The final chapter in the book ties the value of the firm to these three decisions, and provides insight into how firms can enhance value.","Corporate finance Dividend policy Finance Fundamental analysis Stock Discounted cash flow Investment Capital structure Cost of capital"

Rather than offering country-specific protocol and customs, Negotiating Globally provides a general framework to help negotiators anticipate and manage cultural differences.

The well-received chapter on “Government At and Around the Table” has been expanded and updated with new examples that span the globe. In this comprehensive resource, Jeanne M.

She provides a model that explains how the cultural environment affects negotiators’ interests, priorities, and strategies. She provides benchmarks for distinguishing good deals from poor ones and good negotiators from poor ones.

Engaging in the right conversation at the right time is key to both personal and organizational success. And it isn’t just ‘difficult’ conversations that matter. The Four Conversations clearly demonstrates it is the everyday dialogue we have with one another that is critical.  	Armed with a solid body of research and their own first-hand observations, Jeffrey and Laurie Ford identify four types of conversations that every one of us must use to get things done: initiative conversations to introduce something new; understanding conversations to help people relate to new ideas or processes; performance conversations to request specific actions and results; and closure conversations to complete work and give people a sense of accomplishment . They identify the specific elements that make each of these conversations successful and show how they can be put together in different ways to achieve different objectives.  	The Four Conversations demonstrates how to use the right conversation at the right time—planning and starting each one well, and finishing every conversation effectively—to produce the results we want and the improved productivity our organizations need. And through dozens of personal stories and sample dialogues, the authors illustrate how real people in real situations have used the four conversations, either alone or in combination, to more effectively combat common workplace problems and lay the foundations for enduring success: stronger relationships, better buy-in, and a greater feeling of personal and professional achievement for everyone.","Oral communication Conversation"

A comprehensive guide to adding value to supply chain efforts, Using Models to Improve the Supply Chain demonstrates how leading firms have successfully integrated their supply chains and how they plan further progress through supply chain evolution.Using both generic and specific models, the author carefully explains just what’s required for each function of the supply chain and outlines what takes place form lower to higher levels of progress.

Coming to grips with the complexity and fluidity of organization and management is a persistent problem for scholars and practitioners alike, which is why process issues have received renewed interest in recent years. This book, aimed at scholars and higher level students, frames some of these issues in novel and instructive ways.Process views have existed since before the early Greek philosophers and have made decisive marks in all sciences. Alfred North Whitehead’s classic work is a landmark in process philosophy, and his thinking provides renewed impetus to social scientists in search of an expanded framework of process thinking. Theorists such as Niklas Luhmann, Bruno Latour, Karl Weick and James March have contributed significantly towards a process view of organization. In this book, central aspects of their thinking are interpreted and discussed with the help of a broader canvas of process thinking provided by Whitehead. The comparisons do not only allow for interesting connections to be made between the theorists, but they also enable understanding to be made of the thinking behind their respective works. From the analysis, ideas are suggested for a framework for process-based organizational analysis.Advanced students and academics in sociology, organization studies and management studies will find this book useful in its discussion of such subjects as organization theory, process philosophy and process studies.","Information science Systems theory Self-organization Management Meaning Sensemaking Karl E.

Such activity can be summarized by aggregate variables such as an economy’s total production of various goods and services, the aggregate level of unemployment, the general level of interest rates, and the overall level of prices.The focus of this book is on developing simple theoretical models that provide insight into the reasons for fluctuations in such aggregate variables. The models included explore how shocks or ‘impulses’ to the economy (e.g. changes to technology, the money supply, or government policy) impact individuals’ behaviour in specific markets, and the resulting implications in terms of changes in aggregate variables.This book provides the reader with an in-depth understanding of standard theoretical models: Walrasian, Keynesian and Neoclassical.

Innovation is not simply developing new technologies into new products or services, but in many cases finding new models for doing business in the face of change. It often entails changing the rules of the game.From the late 1990s to today, the dominant themes in the strategy literature have been strategic innovation, the impact of information and communications technologies on commerce, and globalization. The primary issues have been and continue to be how to gain a competitive advantage through strategic innovation (what Afuah calls """"new game strategy""""), and how to compete in a world with rapid technological change and increasing globalization. Strategic Innovation demonstrates to students how to create and appropriate value using these """"new game"""" strategies. Beginning with a summary of the major strategic frameworks showing the origins of strategic innovation, Afuah gives a thorough examination of contemporary strategy from an innovation standpoint with several key advantages:  Focus on developing strategy in the face of change Rich in quantitative examples of successful strategies, as well as descriptive cases Emphasis on the analysis of strategy, not just descriptions of strategies A detailed, change-inclusive framework for assessing the profitability potential of a strategy or product, the AVAC (activities, value, appropriability, and change) model Emphasis on the aspects of strategy that can be linked to the determinants of profitability Consideration of how both for-profit and non-profit organizations can benefit from new game strategies""","Strategic management Management Coopetition Game theory Imperfect competition Innovation"

Exploring the shaping of this industry in the years from 1950-1990, this book shows how it has moved from being largely concerned with the technical issues of production to being a key part of the retail industries.Drawing from theoretical traditions such as critical realism and new institutionalism, Strategic and Organizational Change demonstrates the considerable differences between major companies in the industry and the ways in which they have adopted a retailing approach. At the heart of the book is an exploration of the relationship between managerial choice and the structural constraints and opportunities in which that choice was exercised.Providing a new model of how history can inform the analysis of organizational strategy, the book draws on extensive archival material and adopts a far more historical approach than previous accounts of the area.

Demand for formal management training, theories and qualifications has increased, yet our ability to think critically about management has diminished. At a time of organizational and environmental turbulence, the question of effective management is more complex than ever.Unpicking the puzzles faced by both the manager and the student of management, this introductory guide explores the major issues of management, organization and knowledge, asking questions of our 'guru' culture and raising debates on so-called expert thinking. Written from the viewpoint that the most effective managers are those that can think for themselves and put aside the advice of the management 'guru', it is a topical, challenging and thought-provoking study.Thoroughly revised and reorganized, this second edition features two completely new chapters that cover gender issues in management, debates on globalization, post-modernity and the future of management. Designed to bring readers into the debate, rather than simply providing a framework of answers, this new edition also includes an orientation questionnaire, discussion questions for each area covered and further reading suggestions.","Management Administration Business"

John T. Harvey combines analyses rooted in the scholarly traditions of John Maynard Keynes and Thorstein Veblen with that of modern psychology to produce a set of new theories to explain international monetary economics, including not only exchange rates but also world financial crises.In the book, the traditional approach is reviewed and critiqued and the alternative is then built by studying the psychology of the market and balance of payments questions. The central model has at its core Keynes’ analysis of the macroeconomy and it assumes neither full employment nor balanced trade over the short or long run. Market participants’ mental model, which they use to forecast future exchange rate movements, is specified and integrated into the explanation. A separate but related discussion of currency crises shows that three distinct tension points emerge in booming economies, any one of which can break and signal the collapse. Each of the models is compared to post-Bretton Woods history and the reader is shown exactly how various shifts and adjustments on the graphs can explain the dollar’s ups and downs and the Mexican (1994) and Asian (1997) crises.","International trade Economic theories Foreign exchange market Economic indicators Keynesian economics Currency crisis Financial crisis Balance of trade John Maynard Keynes Exchange rate Economics 2008–09 Keynesian resurgence"

This book addresses a wide range of contemporary issues in decision research, such as how individuals deal with uncertainty and complexity, gender-based differences in decision-making, what determines decision performance and why people choose risky activities.The book presents results from academic research carried out over the last twenty years. A common theme is the study of decisions made in horserace betting markets, a research medium which offers a rich insight into decision-making in general and one which enjoys particular methodological advantages over laboratory-based simulations. This set of naturalistic studies explores the variety of individual motivations for betting, how people perceive and respond to the presence of uncertainty, the challenges of complex and turbulent information and the use of heuristics as a response, how decision-making performance is affected by structural or process-related features of the decision environment, and how men and women differ in their decision behaviour.The authors’ interesting and novel findings offer a richer understanding of the psychological and economic underpinnings of betting behaviour which should inform practitioners, policymakers and regulators in an industry which is undergoing unprecedented global growth.

She also assesses the impact that changing financial and economic structures have on determining the specific nature of crises and the differential effect these have in focal point, manner and extent of transmission to other, otherwise unrelated, parts of the economy.Financial Crises offers a consistent method for interpreting variations in financial crises through time and allows for a better overall appreciation for both the transitory fragility and enduring flexibility of financial capitalism and the potential vulnerability created by on-going financial development.

Much has been published on the subject, but the technical nature of most papers makes them difficult for nonspecialists to understand, and the mathematical tools required for applications can be intimidating. Potential users often get the impression that jump and Lévy processes are beyond their reach.Financial Modelling with Jump Processes shows that this is not so. It provides a self-contained overview of the theoretical, numerical, and empirical aspects involved in using jump processes in financial modelling, and it does so in terms within the grasp of nonspecialists. The introduction of new mathematical tools is motivated by their use in the modelling process, and precise mathematical statements of results are accompanied by intuitive explanations.Topics covered in this book include: jump-diffusion models, Lévy processes, stochastic calculus for jump processes, pricing and hedging in incomplete markets, implied volatility smiles, time-inhomogeneous jump processes and stochastic volatility models with jumps. The authors illustrate the mathematical concepts with many numerical and empirical examples and provide the details of numerical implementation of pricing and calibration algorithms.This book demonstrates that the concepts and tools necessary for understanding and implementing models with jumps can be more intuitive that those involved in the Black Scholes and diffusion models. If you have even a basic familiarity with quantitative methods in finance, Financial Modelling with Jump Processes will give you a valuable new set of tools for modelling market fluctuations.","Mathematical finance Options Stochastic processes Quantitative analyst Jump diffusion Volatility smile Financial modeling Black–Scholes model Stochastic volatility Volatility Implied volatility Fabio Mercurio"

Knight occupies a paradoxical place in the history of Chicago economics: vital to the tradition’s teaching of price theory and the twentieth-century re-articulation of the defense of free enterprise and liberal democracy, yet a critic (in advance) of the empirical and methodological orientation that has characterized Chicago economics and the rest of the discipline in the post-war period, and skeptical of liberalism’s prospects. In the course of his investigation of Knight’s work, Emmett has written not only about Knight’s economics and philosophy, the nature of Chicago economics, and Knight’s place in the Chicago tradition, but also about the application of hermeneutic theory to the history of economics, the relation of the history of economic thought to the discipline of economics, and the relation between economics and religion.

Professor Wood argues that economic policies in the United States have been relatively predictable and stable historically, through a detailed examination of conflicts over taxes and monetary policy such as the whiskey rebellion, Magna Carta, the Stamp Act, the Banks of the U.S., and the Federal Reserve. Issues covered also include property, economists’ theories of stabilization, taxes, deficits, and monetary policy.","Public finance Keynesian economics Economic policy Monetary policy Federal Reserve System Fiscal policy Macroeconomics John Maynard Keynes Interaction between monetary and fiscal policies Monetarism"

It concentrates on influential authors in the main schools of institutional economics.Institutional economics is defined as economic thought that considers institutions to be relevant for economic theory, and consequently criticizes the neoclassical mainstream for having pushed them out of the discipline; it deals specially with the nature, the origin, the change of institutions, and their effects on economic performance. It is a family of different theories that were initially influential in economics, then lost much of their weight in the middle half of the 20th century, and eventually recovered significant creative vitality and impact in the last twenty years. The book puts the recent developments in historical perspective by showing how important themes like the importance of habits, the role of formal and informal rules, the relation of organizations and institutions, the hierarchy and complementarity of institutions, the evolutionary character of institutional change, have been explored by various authors or schools.","Institutional economics Schools of economic thought Social institutions Economics Institution Political economy Heterodox economics New institutionalism"

This book bridges the gap between law and economics by confronting normative values that economists too often deem the preserve of moral philosophers. Contract theorists, on the other hand, are seldom in sympathy with economic efficiency norms. While free bargaining continues to be regarded with suspicion by legal scholars who are hostile to private ordering, the proper scope of free bargaining remains in dispute. Combined with a recent renewed interest in this field, these academic tensions mean that the time is right for a reconsideration of contract law.Drawing on scholarship from diverse fields and using illuminating and erudite examples, Just Exchange is entertaining as well as informative. Of interest to economists, lawyers, public policy-makers and those intersted in contract theory, this volume is a valuable overview of a vital intersection between legal studies and economics.","Economics Contract Social contract Libertarian paternalism Bargaining"

Traditionally, strategy and organization development and change have occupied different worlds; one grounded in the economic and management sciences, the other in the applied behavioural sciences. In this enlightening text, Coghlan and Rashford abridge these two worlds using a framework of organizational levels.In this important text, the authors here clearly demonstrate how such processes are brought together in an interlevel approach. They focus on the involvement of such players as:  individuals (CEO, senior managers and others) teams (senior management team, board, other teams) inter-departmental groups (inter-team) the organization (in its external relations).  This interdepartmental aspect of most organizations is critical to developing and deploying strategic actions, yet is often never discussed.Exploring both the external and internal discontinuous nature of forces for change, this book guides the reader through the intricacies of this highly complex subject. Expertly combining theory with practice, it will be a valuable book for masters level and advanced undergraduate students, and for all those concerned with strategy and change.","Management Strategy Change management Strategic management Systems thinking Organization development"

An integral part of this process has been the rise of 'organizational cultures' unique to particular firms. In a world where such cultures are often in conflict with the societies in which they operate how can we understand the workings of cultural patterns and the kinds of transformations they can create?This concise new introductory text provides succint analysis of organizational cultures and types of change they can set in motion. 'culture' is used in an original way to bring together and make sense of cenrtral issues of organizational behaviour. The author explores the way in which forms of culture can influence styles of management, attitudes toward leadership, the level of motivation in the workplace and `hidden agendas' in group dynamics. Organizational Cultures raises the important issue of whether their can be such a thing as a `right decision' for an organization, and brings into focus the major implications and dangers of the growing numbers of supra-national firms both in terms of internal structure and for the context which they function. Throughout, the author succeeds in weaving together behaviour and organization, thus reconciling the traditional divorce between psychology and sociology in the field. Drawing on case studies from Europe, Asia, Africa, Organizational Cultures provides a truly international insight into forms of organizational behaviour. Detailed chapter objectives and summaries are provided to aid progress and self-assessment.","Industrial and organizational psychology Human resource management Social psychology Social systems Organizational theory Organizational culture Organizational behavior Organization development Leadership"

Inspired by Michel Foucault’s framework of critical discourse analysis in The History of Sexuality, the argument dissects the rules of formation that govern the evolving discourse on risk. The author argues that the mathematically formal technology of risk emerges from within specific institutions and economic formations; thereby limiting its utility in the regulation of global financial markets. Exploring how the applied technology of risk has been implicated for fueling a major financial crisis, his work also demonstrates how the regulation of global financial markets and abstruse financial instruments in advanced industrialized countries impacts the lives of the poorest people in developing countries and emerging markets.","Systemic risk World economy Economic bubbles Financial regulation Global financial system International trade Financial crisis of 2007–08 Market Emerging markets Financial crisis Risk"

Both nodal and hierachic concepts of the FEM are examined. Reflecting the growing complexity and multiscale nature of current engineering and scientific problems, the author emphasizes higher-order finite element methods such as the spectral or hp-FEM.A solid introduction to the theory of PDEs and FEM contained in Chapters 1-4 serves as the core and foundation of the publication. Chapter 5 is devoted to modern higher-order methods for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that arise in the semidiscretization of time-dependent PDEs by the Method of Lines (MOL). Chapter 6 discusses fourth-order PDEs rooted in the bending of elastic beams and plates and approximates their solution by means of higher-order Hermite and Argyris elements. Finally, Chapter 7 introduces the reader to various PDEs governing computational electromagnetics and describes their finite element approximation, including modern higher-order edge elements for Maxwell's equations.The understanding of many theoretical and practical aspects of both PDEs and FEM requires a solid knowledge of linear algebra and elementary functional analysis, such as functions and linear operators in the Lebesgue, Hilbert, and Sobolev spaces. These topics are discussed with the help of many illustrative examples in Appendix A, which is provided as a service for those readers who need to gain the necessary background or require a refresher tutorial. Appendix B presents several finite element computations rooted in practical engineering problems and demonstrates the benefits of using higher-order FEM.Numerous finite element algorithms are written out in detail alongside implementation discussions. Exercises, including many that involve programming the FEM, are designed to assist the reader in solving typical problems in engineering and science.Specifically designed as a coursebook, this student-tested publication is geared to upper-level undergraduates and graduate students in all disciplines of computational engineeringand science. It is also a practical problem-solving reference for researchers, engineers, and physicists.","Partial differential equations Finite element method Numerical analysis Structural analysis Computational electromagnetics Stiffness matrix Numerical partial differential equations Hp-FEM"

A large existing literature (e.g., Engle, 1982; Rossi, 1995) models volatility as an average of past shocks, possibly with a noise component. This approach often has difficulty capturing sharp discontinuities and large changes in financial volatility. Their research has shown the advantages of modelling volatility as subject to abrupt regime changes of heterogeneous durations. Using the intuition that some economic phenomena are long-lasting while others are more transient, they permit regimes to have varying degrees of persistence. By drawing on insights from the use of multifractals in the natural sciences and mathematics, they show how to construct high-dimensional regime-switching models that are easy to estimate, and substantially outperform some of the best traditional forecasting models such as GARCH. The goal of their book is to popularize the approach by presenting these exciting new developments to a wider audience. They emphasize both theoretical and empirical applications, beginning with a style that is easily accessible and intuitive in early chapters, and extending to the most rigorous continuous-time and equilibrium pricing formulations in final chapters.","Mathematical finance Fractals Options Technical analysis Markov switching multifractal Multifractal system Volatility Stochastic volatility Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity"

This text combines a rigorous, calculus-based development of theory with a more intuitive approach that appeals to readers' sense of reason and logic, anapproach developed through the author's many years of classroom experience.The text begins with three chapters that develop probability theory and introduce the axioms of probability, random variables, and joint distributions. The next two chapters introduce limit theorems and simulation. Also included is a chapter on statistical inference with a section on Bayesian statistics, which is an important, though often neglected, topic for undergraduate-level texts. Markov chains in discrete and continuous time are also discussed within the book.More than 400 examples are interspersed throughout the text to help illustrate concepts and theory and to assist the reader in developing an intuitive sense of the subject. Readers will find many of the examples to be both entertaining and thought provoking. This is also true for the carefully selected problems that appear at the end of each chapter.This book is an excellent text for upper-level undergraduate courses. While many texts treat probability theory and statistical inference or probability theory and stochastic processes, this text enables students to become proficient in all three of these essential topics. For students in science and engineering who may take only one course in probability theory, mastering all three areas will better prepare them to collect, analyze, and characterize data in their chosen fields.","Statistical theory Probability theory Probability distribution Markov chain Joint probability distribution Statistics Central limit theorem Statistical inference Conditional probability distribution Normal distribution Conditional probability Random variable"

When measured through linear correlation, many of these systems exhibit a slow correlation decay--a phenomenon often referred to as long-memory or long-range dependence. An example of this is the absolute returns of equity data in finance. Selfsimilar stochastic processes (particularly fractional Brownian motion) have long been postulated as a means to model this behavior, and the concept of selfsimilarity for a stochastic process is now proving to be extraordinarily useful. Selfsimilarity translates into the equality in distribution between the process under a linear time change and the same process properly scaled in space, a simple scaling property that yields a remarkably rich theory with far-flung applications.After a short historical overview, this book describes the current state of knowledge about selfsimilar processes and their applications. Concepts, definitions and basic properties are emphasized, giving the reader a road map of the realm of selfsimilarity that allows for further exploration. Such topics as noncentral limit theory, long-range dependence, and operator selfsimilarity are covered alongside statistical estimation, simulation, sample path properties, and stochastic differential equations driven by selfsimilar processes. Numerous references point the reader to current applications.Though the text uses the mathematical language of the theory of stochastic processes, researchers and end-users from such diverse fields as mathematics, physics, biology, telecommunications, finance, econometrics, and environmental science will find it an ideal entry point for studying the already extensive theory and applications of selfsimilarity.","Stochastic processes Fractional Brownian motion Brownian motion Stochastic differential equation Stochastic Lévy process Wiener process Brownian bridge"

While the field of economics makes sharp distinctions and produces precise theory, the work of experimental economics sometimes appear blurred and may produce results that vary from strong support to little or partial support of the relevant theory. At a recent conference, a question was asked about where experimental methods might be more useful than field methods. Although many cannot be answered by experimental methods, there are questions that can only be answered by experiments. Much of the progress of experimental methods involves the posing of old or new questions in a way that experimental methods can be applied. The title of the book reflects the spirit of adventure that experimentalists share and focuses on experiments in general rather than forcing an organization into traditional categories that do not fit. The emphasis reflects the fact that the results do not necessarily demonstrate a consistent theme, but instead reflect bits and pieces of progress as opportunities to pose questions become recognized. This book is a result of an invitation sent from the editors to a broad range of experimenters asking them to write brief notes describing specific experimental results. The challenge was to produce pictures and tables that were self-contained so the reader could understand quickly the essential nature of the experiments and the results.","Game theory Experimental economics Economics Ultimatum game Efficiency wage Dictator game Economic equilibrium Double auction Market Economic bubble Quantal response equilibrium Recognition heuristic"

They are used in many areas including communications systems, transportation networks, image segmentation and analysis, biological systems and DNA sequence analysis, random atomic motion and diffusion in physics, social mobility, population studies, epidemiology, animal and insect migration, queueing systems, resource management, dams, financial engineering, actuarial science, and decision systems. This book, which is written for upper level undergraduate and graduate students, and researchers, presents a unified presentation of Markov processes. In addition to traditional topics such as Markovian queueing system, the book discusses such topics as continuous-time random walk,correlated random walk, Brownian motion, diffusion processes, hidden Markov models, Markov random fields, Markov point processes and Markov chain Monte Carlo. Continuous-time random walk is currently used in econophysics to model the financial market, which has traditionally been modelled as a Brownian motion. Correlated random walk is popularly used in ecological studies to model animal and insect movement. Hidden Markov models are used in speech analysis and DNA sequence analysis while Markov random fields and Markov point processes are used in image analysis.

To this end, the book provides students with a three-tiered learning experience. The first tier provides students with a broad appreciation of the commercial evolution of sport, and how it has managed to move from the kitchen-table model to the corporate-boardroom model, and along the way become quite a sophisticated industry from a financial viewpoint. Attention will be given to the commercial development of sport using USA and European pro-sport leagues as a benchmark. Changes in the funding arrangement of sport will be highlighted, and the different funding sources will be examined in detail. The second tier will give students a sound grounding in the principles and practice of effective financial management. Students will be introduced to basic accounting principles and practice, and then led into more complex issues of pricing, costing, financial analysis, budgeting, and financial projections. The third tier will explore future developments in sport finance and funding, and examine how they will impact on sport management knowledge and skill requirements. Within this framework, the book will provide students with two types of learning outcomes. The first outcome is knowledge based and will include the following: * a grounded understanding of the commercial evolution of sport from 1950-the present * an understanding of the different commercial phases sport goes through to reach commercial maturity * an appreciation of the major global sport events and leagues, and their financial arrangements. * an insight into the financial strengths and weaknesses of contemporary sport.The second outcome is skill-based, and by reading the book and completing the cases students will be able to: * identify the different legal structures of sport organisations and the financial implications of each structure * explain the main accounting conventions and how they impact on the financial management of sport organisations * identify the foundations of double entry bookkeeping * construct a simple set of accounts for a sport organisation * use financial ratio analysis to evaluate the financial performance of sport organisations * understand different methods of constructing budgets, and use them to control the financial operation of a sport organisation * set up models for identifying and managing costs * identify different methods for setting prices for sport goods and services, and to apply them to specific settings and events. * undertake a financial planning exercise and/or feasibility study for a sport organisation or facility * undertake a cost-benefit analysis for a sport organisation event.","Corporate finance Budgets Finance Management accounting Financial management"

This book looks at different risks to supply chains and provides methods to reduce their impact.Constant pressure to improve the efficiency of supply chains, to move materials quickly and at low cost has given rise to a stream of new methods and initiatives. However, there is growing realization that they have created inflexibility that increases the supply chain’s vulnerability to disruptions. Evidence of major consequences are reported regularly in the news, from recent industrial action in American ports stopping the delivery of Chinese goods to Europe, to environmental disasters such as the 2004 Tsunami. But even a small, unexpected event has the potential to bring everything to a standstill including risks such as late deliveries, price rises, road accidents and traffic congestion.Supply Chain Risk Management introduces this important subject and explains why it is vital for managers to understand it. Using jargon-free, accessible language, it identifies both the possible effects that risks can cause and how to plan for them. Starting with a definition of risk and supply chain management, it explains the current trends affecting the supply chain and provides detailed guidance on how to identify and analyse risks. It develops the principles involved, describing the various approaches to take and the steps needed to implement it. There is advice on how to create a resilient supply chain and, in the worst case scenario, how to plan for and respond to an extreme risk.

In Analysis of Evolutionary Processes, Fabio Dercole and Sergio Rinaldi have written the first comprehensive book on Adaptive Dynamics (AD), a quantitative modeling approach that explicitly links evolutionary changes to demographic ones. The book shows how the so-called AD canonical equation can answer questions of paramount interest in biology, engineering, and the social sciences, especially economics.  	After introducing the basics of evolutionary processes and classifying available modeling approaches, Dercole and Rinaldi give a detailed presentation of the derivation of the AD canonical equation, an ordinary differential equation that focuses on evolutionary processes driven by rare and small innovations. The authors then look at important features of evolutionary dynamics as viewed through the lens of AD. They present their discovery of the first chaotic evolutionary attractor, which calls into question the common view that coevolution produces exquisitely harmonious adaptations between species. And, opening up potential new lines of research by providing the first application of AD to economics, they show how AD can explain the emergence of technological variety.  	Analysis of Evolutionary Processes will interest anyone looking for a self-contained treatment of AD for self-study or teaching, including graduate students and researchers in mathematical and theoretical biology, applied mathematics, and theoretical economics.","Evolutionary biology Evolutionary dynamics Evolutionary invasion analysis Bifurcation theory Mathematical and theoretical biology Attractor Chaos theory Coevolution Dynamical system Outline of evolution"

The Difference is about how we think in groups--and how our collective wisdom exceeds the sum of its parts. Why can teams of people find better solutions than brilliant individuals working alone? And why are the best group decisions and predictions those that draw upon the very qualities that make each of us unique? The answers lie in diversity--not what we look like outside, but what we look like within, our distinct tools and abilities.The Difference reveals that progress and innovation may depend less on lone thinkers with enormous IQs than on diverse people working together and capitalizing on their individuality. Page shows how groups that display a range of perspectives outperform groups of like-minded experts. Diversity yields superior outcomes, and Page proves it using his own cutting-edge research. Moving beyond the politics that cloud standard debates about diversity, he explains why difference beats out homogeneity, whether you're talking about citizens in a democracy or scientists in the laboratory. He examines practical ways to apply diversity's logic to a host of problems, and along the way offers fascinating and surprising examples, from the redesign of the Chicago """"El"""" to the truth about where we store our ketchup.Page changes the way we understand diversity--how to harness its untapped potential, how to understand and avoid its traps, and how we can leverage our differences for the benefit of all.""","Identity politics Human resource management Affirmative action Multiculturalism Discrimination Diversity Biodiversity"

The stories of these families are often surprising and inspiring. Most poor households do not live hand to mouth, spending what they earn in a desperate bid to keep afloat. Instead, they employ financial tools, many linked to informal networks and family ties. They push money into savings for reserves, squeeze money out of creditors whenever possible, run sophisticated savings clubs, and use microfinancing wherever available.

But probability and statistics  are becoming increasingly important in today’s society.  As the basic  ideas are being taught in elementary schools through college, it’s  important that everyone has a basic understanding of probability theory. Probability theory explains the happenings that occur due to chance.   Although it is not possible to predict for certain the individual  outcome of a chance process, it is possible to determine outcomes in the  “long run,” and to predict the probability that something will  eventually occur. This book will present the basics of probability in a non-rigorous  manner.  Only an understanding of arithmetic and some basic algebra are  necessary to learn these ideas.  No high-powered mathematical notation  or formal proofs will be used, rather the concepts will be developed  from examples using coins, dice, cards, and other common probability  devices.","Probability theory Probability Outcome Event Probability space"

The complex nature and the size of the market have given rise to very complex counterparty credit risks.  The Lehman failure has shown that these issues can paralyse the financial markets, and the need for detailed understanding has never been greater.The Art of Credit Derivatives shows practitioners how to put a framework in place which will support the securitization activity.  By showing the models that support this activity and linking them with very practical examples, the authors show why a mind-shift within the quant community is needed - a move from simple modeling to a more hands on mindset where the modeler understands the trading implicitly.The book has been written in five parts, covering the modeling framework; single name corporate credit derivatives; multi name corporate credit derivatives; asset backed securities and dynamic credit portfolio management.Coverage includes:      groundbreaking solutions to the inherent risks associated with investing in securitization instruments     how to use the standardized credit indices as the most appropriate instruments in price discovery processes and why these indices are the essential tools for short term credit portfolio management     why the dynamics of systemic correlation and the standardised credit indices are linked with leverage, and consequently the implications for liquidity and solvability of financial institutions     how Lévy processes and long term memory processes are related to the understanding of economic activity     why regulatory capital should be portfolio dependant and how to use stress tests and scenario analysis to model this     how to put structured products in a mark-to market-environment, increasing transparency for accounting and compliance.

Derived from the authors teaching notes and years spent training practitioners in risk management techniques, it brings together the three key disciplines of finance, statistics and modeling (programming), to provide a thorough grounding in risk management techniques.Written by renowned risk expert Jon Danielsson, the book begins with an introduction to financial markets and market prices, volatility clusters, fat tails and nonlinear dependence. It then goes on to present volatility forecasting with both univatiate and multivatiate methods, discussing the various methods used by industry, with a special focus on the GARCH family of models. The evaluation of the quality of forecasts is discussed in detail. Next, the main concepts in risk and models to forecast risk are discussed, especially volatility, value-at-risk and expected shortfall. The focus is both on risk in basic assets such as stocks and foreign exchange, but also calculations of risk in bonds and options, with analytical methods such as delta-normal VaR and duration-normal VaR and Monte Carlo simulation. The book then moves on to the evaluation of risk models with methods like backtesting, followed by a discussion on stress testing. The book concludes by focussing on the forecasting of risk in very large and uncommon events with extreme value theory and considering the underlying assumptions behind almost every risk model in practical use – that risk is exogenous – and what happens when those assumptions are violated.Every method presented brings together theoretical discussion and derivation of key equations and a discussion of issues in practical implementation. Each method is implemented in both MATLAB and R, two of the most commonly used mathematical programming languages for risk forecasting with which the reader can implement the models illustrated in the book.The book includes four appendices. The first introduces basic concepts in statistics and financial time series referred to throughout the book. The second and third introduce R and MATLAB, providing a discussion of the basic implementation of the software packages. And the final looks at the concept of maximum likelihood, especially issues in implementation and testing.The book is accompanied by a website - www.financialriskforecasting.com – which features downloadable code as used in the book.","Mathematical finance Financial risk Actuarial science Technical analysis Market risk Volatility Quantitative analyst Expected shortfall Value at risk Backtesting Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity Certificate in Quantitative Finance"

Through a modern approach that utilizes fully calculated problems, the book addresses the importance of calculus and analysis in the applied sciences, with a focus on differential equations.Differing from the common classical approach to the topic, this book presents a modern perspective on calculus that follows motivations from Otto Toeplitz's famous genetic model. The result is an introduction that leads to great simplifications and provides a focused treatment commonly found in the applied sciences, particularly differential equations. The author begins with a short introduction to elementary mathematical logic. Next, the book explores the concept of sets and maps, providing readers with a strong foundation for understanding and solving modern mathematical problems. Ensuring a complete presentation, topics are uniformly presented in chapters that consist of three parts:    - Introductory Motivations presents historical mathematical problems or problems arising from applications that led to the development of mathematical solutions    - Theory provides rigorous development of the essential parts of the machinery of analysis; proofs are intentionally detailed, but simplified as much as possible to aid reader comprehension- Examples and Problems promotes problem-solving skills through application-based exercises that emphasize theoretical mechanics, general relativity, and quantum mechanics Calculus and Analysis: A Combined Approach is an excellent book for courses on calculus and mathematical analysis at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and anyone working in the applied sciences who would like to master their understanding of basic tools in modern calculus and analysis.","Functions and mappings Mathematical analysis Calculus Integral Vector calculus Generalizations of the derivative Derivative Differential equation Vector space Henri Lebesgue Outline of calculus Multiplicative calculus"

Not only is OD a growing field in itself, it is also growing as a component of management, human resource development, industrial and organizational psychology, and human resource management.  	Organization Development is a new textbook designed to be used in undergraduate and graduate programs in any of these disciplines. Gary McLean provides readers with an overview of the field and acquaints them with the basic principles, practices, values, and skills of OD. Most of the existing books in OD have focused on narrow theory or practice perspectives, and focus more on process rather than outcomes. Organization Development successfully combines theory and practice; process and outcomes; performance and affective results; effectiveness and efficiency.  	McLean covers every aspect of the work of an OD professional and features case studies in every chapter. He explains how OD professionals actually get work and what the first steps in any OD effort should be. He surveys different ways to assess an organizational situation--including a comparison of the Action Research and Appreciative Inquiry models--and provides forms for devising an action plan based on that assessment. McLean then looks at how to choose and implement a range of interventions at different levels. Uniquely, Organization Development goes beyond the organizational level to look at the application of OD on community, national, regional, and global levels. And the book offers guidance on what to do afterwards, including how to evaluate the results of an intervention and how to resolve the controversy over adopting a particular change method versus remaining in a state of constant change. McLean closes with an overview of the field's basic values and competencies and a look towards the future.","Human resource management Change management Organization development Organizational theory Industrial and organizational psychology Appreciative inquiry Competence Organizational identification"

René Carmona brings together a who's who of leading experts in the field to provide the definitive introduction for students, scholars, and researchers. Until recently, financial mathematicians and engineers developed pricing and hedging procedures that assumed complete markets. But markets are generally incomplete, and it may be impossible to hedge against all sources of randomness. Indifference Pricing offers cutting-edge procedures developed under more realistic market assumptions.  	The book begins by introducing the concept of indifference pricing in the simplest possible models of discrete time and finite state spaces where duality theory can be exploited readily. It moves into a more technical discussion of utility indifference pricing for diffusion models, and then addresses problems of optimal design of derivatives by extending the indifference pricing paradigm beyond the realm of utility functions into the realm of dynamic risk measures.

This book provides a new, comprehensive, and in-depth examination of the standard theories and latest research in exchange-rate economics. Covering a vast swath of theoretical and empirical work, the book explores established theories of exchange-rate determination using macroeconomic fundamentals, and presents unique microbased approaches that combine the insights of microstructure models with the macroeconomic forces driving currency trading.  	Macroeconomic models have long assumed that agents--households, firms, financial institutions, and central banks--all have the same information about the structure of the economy and therefore hold the same expectations and uncertainties regarding foreign currency returns. Microbased models, however, look at how heterogeneous information influences the trading decisions of agents and becomes embedded in exchange rates. Replicating key features of actual currency markets, these microbased models generate a rich array of empirical predictions concerning trading patterns and exchange-rate dynamics that are strongly supported by data. The models also show how changing macroeconomic conditions exert an influence on short-term exchange-rate dynamics via their impact on currency trading.

Until recently, however, economic research on this question either ignored people's uncertainty about their future productivities or imposed strong and unrealistic functional form restrictions on taxes. In response to these problems, the new dynamic public finance was developed to study the design of optimal taxes given only minimal restrictions on the set of possible tax instruments, and on the nature of shocks affecting people in the economy. In this book, Narayana Kocherlakota surveys and discusses this exciting new approach to public finance.  	An important book for advanced PhD courses in public finance and macroeconomics, The New Dynamic Public Finance provides a formal connection between the problem of dynamic optimal taxation and dynamic principal-agent contracting theory. This connection means that the properties of solutions to principal-agent problems can be used to determine the properties of optimal tax systems. The book shows that such optimal tax systems necessarily involve asset income taxes, which may depend in sophisticated ways on current and past labor incomes. It also addresses the implications of this new approach for qualitative properties of optimal monetary policy, optimal government debt policy, and optimal bequest taxes. In addition, the book describes computational methods for approximate calculation of optimal taxes, and discusses possible paths for future research.  	Narayana R.

Inevitably a modern treatment of such a complex topic requires a quantitative perspective, a solid dynamic theory background, and the development of empirical and numerical methods--which is where Canova's book differs from typical graduate textbooks in macroeconomics and econometrics. Rather than list a series of estimators and their properties, Canova starts from a class of DSGE models, finds an approximate linear representation for the decision rules, and describes methods needed to estimate their parameters, examining their fit to the data. The book is complete with numerous examples and exercises.  	Today's economic analysts need a strong foundation in both theory and application. Methods for Applied Macroeconomic Research offers the essential tools for the next generation of macroeconomists.","Statistical inference Formal sciences Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium Econometrics Statistics Estimation theory Bayesian Stochastic volatility Macroeconomic model"

The focus is on Britain after a decade of public policy which has once again altered the terrain on which employment relations develop. Government has attempted to balance flexibility with fairness, preserving light-touch regulation whilst introducing rights to minimum wages and to employee representation in the workplace. Yet this is an open economy, conditioned significantly by developing patterns of international trade and by European Union policy initiatives. This interaction of domestic and cross-national influences in analysis of changes in employment relations runs throughout the volume.  	The structure has been amended slightly. Britain is placed straight away in comparative perspective before attention focuses explicitly on employment relations actors, contexts, processes, and outcomes. Each of the chapters is written by authorities in the field and provides up to date analysis and commentary. A spine of chapters from the preceding volume have been revised and extensively updated and new chapters have been added to refine coverage of issues such as the private sector and developing legal institutions.  	Overall, a picture emerges of an economy that is in incremental and contested transition. The imperatives of 'globalization' now infuse governance mechanisms that were once responsive principally to domestic agenda and employment standards are set now by the state that once were established through collective bargaining. It is this fragile and emerging model that will be tested significantly through sustained political and economic change.  	""""Completely revised, the latest edition of Industrial Relations provides an invaluable guide to the actors, contexts, processes and significant outcomes within British employment relations. Based on a thorough review of the latest research, it is essential reading for students, academics and those professionally involved in employment relations and human resource management."""" 	—Edmund Heery, Cardiff Business School  	""""This is a terrific collection of insightful analyses of British workplace relations in a global context provided by leading scholars. The chapters creatively utilize a multidisciplinary and critical approach that reveals the continuing and unique value of an industrial relations perspective. The volume cleverly assesses how factors including increased demographic diversity, organizational restructuring, globalization, and the reduced coverage of collective bargaining are affecting the nature and evolution of work and workplace relations. It is a must read. 	—Harry C. Katz, Cornell University, New York  	""""This volume definitely constitutes the most comprehensive and best collection of empirical as well as analytical essays on industrial relations in Great Britain.

The book presents theory without unnecessary abstraction; quantitative techniques with a minimum of mathematics; and conventions at a useful level of detail.  	The book begins with an overview of global fixed income markets and continues with the fundamentals, namely, arbitrage pricing, interest rates, risk metrics, and term structure models to price contingent claims. Subsequent chapters cover individual markets and securities: repo, rate and bond forwards and futures, interest rate and basis swaps, credit markets, fixed income options, and mortgage-backed-securities.  	Fixed Income Securities, Third Edition is full of examples, applications, and case studies. Practically every quantitative concept is illustrated through real market data. This practice-oriented approach makes the book particularly useful for the working professional.  	This third edition is a considerable revision and expansion of the second. Most examples have been updated. The chapters on fixed income options and mortgage-backed securities have been considerably expanded to include a broader range of securities and valuation methodologies. Also, three new chapters have been added: the global overview of fixed income markets; a chapter on corporate bonds and credit default swaps; and a chapter on discounting with bases, which is the foundation for the relatively recent practice of discounting swap cash flows with curves based on money market rates.","United States housing bubble Structured finance Financial markets Arbitrage Derivative Futures contract Fixed income Swap Mortgage-backed security Credit default swap Bond Interest rate swap"

Depending on the availability of resources, a multiple project environment can accomplish substantial work while lowering the overhead burden of project management by consolidating processes.  In this book, you will learn how to recognize the characteristics and to manage effectively in each of these situations, how to plan and organize your work, how to influence other people who may not report to you in an official supervisory capacity, and how to get results.

The authors' focus, however, is not just on solving the models, but also on developing the ability to modify them to reflect one's interest and point of view. The result is a book that enables students to be creative in developing models that are relevant to the economic problems of their times.  	Unlike other computational economics textbooks, this book is organized around economic topics, among them macroeconomics, microeconomics, and finance. The authors employ various software systems--including MATLAB, Mathematica, GAMS, the nonlinear programming solver in Excel, and the database systems in Access--to enable students to use the most advantageous system.

This book fills a gap by providing advanced undergraduate and graduate students with the latest research and methodologies in an accessible and comprehensive way. It is an indispensable reference for researchers in economic geography, regional and urban economics, international trade, and applied econometrics, and can serve as a resource for economists in government.  Economic Geography presents advances in economic theory that explain why, despite the increasing mobility of commodities, ideas, and people, the diffusion of economic activity is very unequal and remains agglomerated in a limited number of spatial entities. The book complements theoretical analysis with detailed discussions of the empirics of the economics of agglomeration, offering a mix of theoretical and empirical research that gives a unique perspective on spatial disparities. It reveals how location continues to matter for trade and economic development, yet how economic integration is transforming the global economy into an economic space in which activities are performed within large metropolitan areas exchanging goods, skills, and information. Economic Geography examines the future implications of this evolution in the spatial economy and relates them to other major social and economic trends.

Unfortunately, most yield curve models tend to be theoretically rigorous but empirically disappointing, or empirically successful but theoretically lacking. In this book, Francis Diebold and Glenn Rudebusch propose two extensions of the classic yield curve model of Nelson and Siegel that are both theoretically rigorous and empirically successful. The first extension is the dynamic Nelson-Siegel model (DNS), while the second takes this dynamic version and makes it arbitrage-free (AFNS). Diebold and Rudebusch show how these two models are just slightly different implementations of a single unified approach to dynamic yield curve modeling and forecasting. They emphasize both descriptive and efficient-markets aspects, they pay special attention to the links between the yield curve and macroeconomic fundamentals, and they show why DNS and AFNS are likely to remain of lasting appeal even as alternative arbitrage-free models are developed.

This edition breaks away even further from the traditional structure of so many standard HRM textbooks. It challenges a broadening of the ‘agenda’ and scope of HRM work: HRM is not only about managing employees, but also about managing the work and the people who do the work of and in organisations. This may involve alternative ways of getting the work of organisations done superiorly. This book will help you to apply HRM effectively to achieve its ultimate aim, namely to add value to people, to organisations and to society.","Human resource management Evaluation Organizational culture Human resources Occupational safety and health South African labour law Reward management"

Setting aside the classical theory of probability measure spaces, the book utilizes a mathematically rigorous version of the theory of random variation that bases itself exclusively on finitely additive probability distribution functions.  		In place of twentieth century Lebesgue integration and measure theory, the author uses the simpler concept of Riemann sums, and the non-absolute Riemann-type integration of Henstock. Readers are supplied with an accessible approach to standard elements of probability theory such as the central limmit theorem and Brownian motion as well as remarkable, new results on Feynman diagrams and stochastic integrals.  		Throughout the book, detailed numerical demonstrations accompany the discussions of abstract mathematical theory, from the simplest elements of the subject to the most complex. In addition, an array of numerical examples and vivid illustrations showcase how the presented methods and applications can be undertaken at various levels of complexity.  A Modern Theory of Random Variation is a suitable book for courses on mathematical analysis, probability theory, and mathematical finance at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. The book is also an indispensible resource for researchers and practitioners who are seeking new concepts, techniques and methodologies in data analysis, numerical calculation, and financial asset valuation.

The book only requires the reader to be knowledgeable in the basics of algebra and statistics.  		The Mathematical formulae are only fully proven when the proof brings some useful insight. These formulae are translated from algebra into plain English to aid understanding as the vast majority of practitioners involved in the financial markets are not required to compute or calculate prices or sensitivities themselves as they have access to data providers. Thus, the intention of this book is for the practitioner to gain a deeper understanding of these calculations, both for a safety reason – it is better to understand what is behind the data we manipulate – and secondly being able to appreciate the magnitude of the prices we are confronted with and being able to draft a rough calculation, aside of the market data.  		The author has avoided excessive formalism where possible. Formalism is securing the outputs of research, but may, in other circumstances, burden the understanding by non-mathematicians; an example of this case is in the chapter dedicated to the basis of stochastic calculus.  		The book is divided into two parts:  		-          First, the deterministic world, starting from the yield curve building and related calculations (spot rates, forward rates, discrete versus continuous compounding, etc.), and continuing with spot instruments valuation (short term rates, bonds, currencies and stocks) and forward instruments valuation (forward forex, FRAs and variants, swaps & futures);  		-          Second, the probabilistic world, starting with the basis of stochastic calculus and the alternative approach of ARMA to GARCH, and continuing with derivative pricing: options, second generation options, volatility, credit derivatives;  		-          This second part is completed by a chapter dedicated to market performance & risk measures, and a chapter widening the scope of quantitative models beyond the Gaussian hypothesis and evidencing the potential troubles linked to derivative pricing models.","Mathematical finance Options Quantitative analyst Yield curve Derivative Futures contract Swap Certificate in Quantitative Finance Outline of finance"

An original treatment of the subject rather than a textbook synthesis, the book contains new analysis that generates novel results, including some that overturn long-standing conventional wisdom. This fresh approach should change thinking, research, and teaching for decades to come.  	Building on the work of James Mirrlees, Anthony Atkinson and Joseph Stiglitz, and subsequent researchers, and in the spirit of classics by A. C. Pigou, William Vickrey, and Richard Musgrave, this book steps back from particular lines of inquiry to consider the field as a whole, including the relationships among different fiscal instruments. Louis Kaplow puts forward a framework that makes it possible to rigorously examine both distributive and distortionary effects of particular policies despite their complex interactions with others. To do so, various reforms--ranging from commodity or estate and gift taxation to regulation and public goods provision--are combined with a distributively offsetting adjustment to the income tax. The resulting distribution-neutral reform package holds much constant while leaving in play the distinctive effects of the policy instrument under consideration. By applying this common methodology to disparate subjects, The Theory of Taxation and Public Economics produces significant cross-fertilization and yields solutions to previously intractable problems.","Public finance Income distribution Taxation Socioeconomics Optimal tax Tax Public economics James Mirrlees Distortion Distribution Redistribution Welfare economics"

Rather than being traded through a centralized institution such as a stock exchange, OTC trades are negotiated privately between market participants who may be unaware of prices that are currently available elsewhere in the market. In these relatively opaque markets, investors can be in the dark about the most attractive available terms and who might be offering them. This opaqueness exacerbated the financial crisis, as regulators and market participants were unable to quickly assess the risks and pricing of these instruments.  Dark Markets offers a concise introduction to OTC markets by explaining key conceptual issues and modeling techniques, and by providing readers with a foundation for more advanced subjects in this field. Darrell Duffie covers the basic methods for modeling search and random matching in economies with many agents. He gives an overview of asset pricing in OTC markets with symmetric and asymmetric information, showing how information percolates through these markets as investors encounter each other over time. This book also features appendixes containing methodologies supporting the more theory-oriented of the chapters, making this the most self-contained introduction to OTC markets available.","Financial markets Systemic risk Derivative Transparency Financial crisis of 2007–08 Finance Futures contract Financial economics Stock market"

The Economics of Commodity Markets attempts to bridge the gap between academics and working professionals by way of a textbook that is both theoretically informative and practical. Based in part on the authors’ teaching experience of commodity finance at the University Paris Dauphine, the book covers all important commodity markets topics and includes coverage of recent topics such as financial applications and intuitive economic reasoning.  	The book is composed of three parts that cover: commodity market dynamics, commodities and the business cycle, and commodities and fundamental value. The key original approach to the subject matter lies in a shift away from the descriptive to the econometric analysis of commodity markets. Information on market trends of commodities is presented in the first part, with a strong emphasis on the quantitative treatment of that information in the remaining two parts of the book. Readers are provided with a clear and succinct exposition of up-to-date financial economic and econometric methods as these apply to commodity markets. In addition a number of useful empirical applications are introduced and discussed.  	This book is a self-contained offering, discussing all key methods and insights without descending into superfluous technicalities.

Quite simply the 20th century concept of advertising is dead and it will have to reinvent itself in order to survive. This transformation is going on as we speak. Brands that invest in advertising during an economic recession prove to overcome them quicker as times of crisis are typically moments when consumers' mental pecking order is being shaken up. When brand market shares are shifting advertising can be a determining factor for the future of brands. In Advertising: dead or alive, Fons Van Dyck offers strategic answers to questions marketers and managers have about the effectiveness of advertising in the digital age. He discusses the basics of how advertising works in marketing and communications planning today. What is the core target group of advertising? Which strategy works best? Does social media mean the end of advertising? Why is the integration of marketing and communication becoming increasingly important? Are consumers better at advertising? He addresses current advertising practice. What works best: a USP (unique selling proposition) or ESP (emotional selling proposition)? Is the future of advertising global or local? Is 'green' really a sales argument, and if it is, for what type of customer? What is the power of 'retro' in advertising? He explores what academic evidence is available today that demonstrates the added value of marketing and advertising for companies and organisations, even in times of economic recession and concludes by focusing on some of the most important topics of criticism brands and advertising in particular are facing and on how brands are responding.

Previously credit tended to be acknowledged only when dealing with counterparty credit risk, high-yield debt or credit-linked derivatives, now it affects all things, including such fundamental concepts as assessing the present value of a future cash flow. The purpose of this book is to analyze credit from the beginning—the point at which any borrowing entity (sovereign, corporate, etc.) decides to raise capital through its treasury operation. To describe the debt management activity, the book presents examples from the development banking world which not only presents a clearer banking structure but in addition sits at the intersection of many topical issues (multi-lateral agencies, quasi-governmental entities, Emerging Markets, shrinking pool of AAA borrowers, etc.).  			This book covers:   				Curve construction (instruments, collateralization, discounting, bootstrapping)  				Credit and fair valuing of loans (modeling, development institutions)  				Emerging markets and liquidity (liquidity, credit, capital control, development)  				Bond pricing (credit, illiquid bonds, recovery pricing)  				Treasury (funding as an asset swap structure, benchmarks for borrowing/investing)  				Risk and asset liability management (leverage, hedging, funding risk)","Systemic risk Banking Financial markets United States housing bubble Credit risk Credit scoring Asset liability management Bank Finance Investment banking Market liquidity Yield curve"

Why did no one see it coming? And how did our banks lose so much of our money? What's being done to sort out the banking industry? And will it work? These are the questions that industry experts Adrian Docherty and Franck Viort cover in Better Banking: Understanding and Addressing the Failures in Risk Management, Governance and Regulation. They give a clear and thorough run-through of some of the key concepts and developments in banking, to enable the reader to understand better this vital yet perilous industry. Without excessive detail or jargon, they explain the most important issues in risk management, regulation and governance and build a comprehensive description of how failings in these areas resulted in the current financial crisis. In order to make the diagnosis clear, the authors illustrate their descriptions with a series of informative case studies. The book revolves around a critique of the current regulatory developments, which the authors feel will be ineffective in fixing the structural flaws in banking. Crucially, and as the title of the book suggests, they set out their own series of proposals to contribute to the development of a better, safer and more effective banking industry. Docherty and Viort's book fills an important gap in the literature on banking and its role in the current financial crisis. It is at once a history, a primer, a critique and a manifesto. It does not take sides but works through a constructive diagnosis towards ideas that could lead to major improvements in the quality and stability of the financial world. Better Banking: Understanding and Addressing the Failures in Risk Management, Governance and Regulation is a technical yet accessible book that seeks to engage interested readers of all kinds -- students, professionals, bankers and regulators but also politicians and the broader audience of citizens outside the banking industry, who are keen to inform themselves and understand what needs to be done to avoid a repeat of this crisis.","Systemic risk Bank regulation Bank Financial crisis of 2007–08 Global financial system Financial crisis Systemically important financial institution International Financial Congress Basel II"

The book then features the valuation models that can be used to determine the value of banks and insurance companies including the Discounted Cash Flow, Dividend Discount Model, and Residual Income Model (with the appropriate estimation techniques for the cost of capital and cash flow in financial industries). The main techniques to perform the relative valuation of financial institutions are then presented: along the traditional multiples (P/E, P/BV, P/TBV, P/NAV), the multiples based on industry-specific value drivers are discussed (for example, P/Pre Provision Profit, P/Deposits, P/Premiums, P/Number of branches).

The logic is so compelling that the models are widely used in policy, from banking, investments, and corporate finance to government. To what extent, however, can these models predict what actually happens in financial markets? In The Paradox of Asset Pricing, a leading financial researcher argues forcefully that the empirical record is weak at best. Peter Bossaerts undertakes the most thorough, technically sound investigation in many years into the scientific character of the pricing of financial assets. He probes this conundrum by modeling a decidedly volatile phenomenon that, he says, the world of finance has forgotten in its enthusiasm for the efficient markets hypothesis--speculation.  	   	Bossaerts writes that the existing empirical evidence may be tainted by the assumptions needed to make sense of historical field data or by reanalysis of the same data. To address the first problem, he demonstrates that one central assumption--that markets are efficient processors of information, that risk is a knowable quantity, and so on--can be relaxed substantially while retaining core elements of the existing methodology. The new approach brings novel insights to old data. As for the second problem, he proposes that asset pricing theory be studied through experiments in which subjects trade purposely designed assets for real money. This book will be welcomed by finance scholars and all those math--and statistics-minded readers interested in knowing whether there is science beyond the mathematics of finance.  	   	This book provided the foundation for subsequent journal articles that won two prestigious awards: the 2003 Journal of Financial Markets Best Paper Award and the 2004 Goldman Sachs Asset Management Best Research Paper for the Review of Finance.","Financial markets Mathematical finance Financial economics Finance Efficient-market hypothesis Portfolio Corporate finance Quantitative analyst Capital asset pricing model"

The Purchasing department must prove that it can have a positive impact on product quality and innovation, and also EBIT or working capital, and that it is contributing to decision-making regarding the company's strategic investments.   The argument put forward in this work is clear: the Purchasing Function is no longer a """"support function"""" that simply carries out purchase requests. It is now a """"Business & Financial Partner"""" of Executive Management, and it must substantially contribute to crafting and implementing strategy, and to financial steering, risk management, and value creation.   It must be part in the company's key decisions, which mainly rely on financial criteria, and work across all functions with the other Functional and Operational divisions.   The Purchasing Function should serve as an active contributor to the company's competitiveness, on equal footing with the other functions.  This book is intended for Purchasing departments as well as Executive Management and Finance departments that wish to successfully transform the Purchasing Function into a strategic driver for performance and value creation for their company.  Its aim is to provide the reader with a clear and concrete 7-step method to implement in order to make the changes expected by Executive Management and stakeholders, and thus holds the keys to writing Purchasing’s new roadmap to success. ""","Supply chain management Systems engineering Procurement Management Operations research Purchasing Finance Purchasing card Purchasing management"

Most often remembered as an expositor of David Ricardo and as the most unforgettable home-schooling parent of all time - through the eyes of his ultimately more famous son, John Stuart Mill, James Mill’s original work has much to offer. Consider the excellent summaries of diminishing marginal returns in Chapter II, of comparative advantage in Chapter III, Section V, of the quantity theory of money and the market for foreign exchange in Chapter III, Sections VII-XVI, and of the aggregate budget constraint and the relationship between bequests and tax burdens in Chapter IV. James Mill’s exposition of the labor theory of value is so compelling and simple that it stood for over a generation, to much unfortunate misapplication.

He pointed out that the whole economy is the result of what individuals do. Individuals act, choose, cooperate, compete, and trade with one another. In this way Mises explained how complex market phenomena develop. Mises did not simply describe economic phenomena - prices, wages, interest rates, money, monopoly and even the trade cycle - he explained them as the outcomes of countless conscious, purposive actions, choices, and preferences of individuals, each of whom was trying as best as he or she could under the circumstances to attain various wants and ends and to avoid undesired consequences.

As a result, credit risk trading and credit portfolio management gained significantly in importance. The book shows how to optimize, manage, and hedge liquid credit portfolios, i.e. applying innovative derivative instruments. Against the background of the highly complex structure of credit derivatives, the book points out how to implement portfolio optimization concepts using credit-relevant parameters, and basic Markowitz or more sophisticated modified approaches (e.g., Conditional Value at Risk, Omega optimization) to fulfill the special needs of an active credit portfolio management on a single-name and on a portfolio basis (taking default correlation within a credit risk model framework into account). This includes appropriate strategies to analyze the impact from credit-relevant newsflow (macro- and micro-fundamental news, rating actions, etc.). As credits resemble equity-linked instruments, we also highlight how to implement debt-equity strategies, which are based on a modified Merton approach.

There have been quite a few accounting scandals in Asia in the recent years – now rivaling those we have seen in the Americas and Europe. Assessing potential or active overseas investments requires reliance on financial statements, the full parameters of which may vary from region to region. To effectively analyze statements, it is necessary to first understand the framework underlying these financial statements and then lay out a protocol for detecting irregularities. It's impossible to create and implement a practical plan without a deeper knowledge of the various factors at play.  Asian Statement Analysis: Detecting Financial Irregularities provides a framework for analysis that makes irregularities stand out. Authors Chin Hwee Tan and Thomas R. Robinson discuss international financial reporting standards, including characteristics particular to the Asian region. Tan and Robinson's combined background in academia and Asian finance give them a multi-modal perspective and position them as top authorities on the topic. In the book, they address issues such as:   		Detection of irregularities independent of particular accounting rules  		The most common irregularities in the Asian market  		Similarities and differences between U.S. and Asian accounting techniques  		An overarching framework for irregularity detection   	The book uses real-world examples to illustrate the concepts presented, with the focus on Asian companies. As the first ever in-depth study on manipulation and irregularities in the Asian market, Asian Financial Statement Analysis: Detecting Financial Irregularities is uniquely positioned to be a valuable resource in the move toward the next phase of global reporting standards.","Financial accounting Financial statement Accounting International Financial Reporting Standards"

Therefore, there is a need to update the book to incorporate not just more relevant and up-to-date case studies of deals but to show the ‘new’ way of operating in a post-Lehman environment.

Disruptive innovations, radical thinking, new business models and resource scarcity are impacting every sector. Although the scale of expected change is not unprecedented, what is unique is the pervasive nature of the change and its accelerating pace which people in organizations have to cope with. Structures, systems, processes and strategies are relatively simple to understand and even fix. People, however, are more complex. Change can have a different impact on each of them, all of which can cause different attitudes and reactions. Managing and Leading People Through Organizational Change is written for leaders with the key responsibility of managing people through transitions. Managing and Leading People through Organizational Change provides a critical analysis of change and transformation in organizations from a theoretical and practical perspective. It addresses the individual, team and organizational issues of leading and managing people before, during and after change, using case studies and interviews with people from organizations in different sectors across the globe. This book demonstrates how theory can be applied in practice through practical examples and recommendations, focusing on the importance of understanding the impact of the nature of change on individuals and engaging them collaboratively throughout the transformation journey.","Design Innovation"

This has lasting impact in terms of meeting business objectives and becoming an employer of choice. We need to change the way we manage change in organizations: by understanding the brain we can do this better. Neuroscience brings a new lens through which to look at people and to understand why they react to situations in a certain way, what they need from work relationships to perform at their best, and how they might be better motivated. Neuroscience for Organizational Change not only provides evidence that will persuade the most sceptical of leaders but also provides many practical examples of how to apply the insights. The book provides a 'win-win': it will enable the organization to improve performance and also help to support the mental and emotional well-being of employees. Amongst other areas, Neuroscience for Organizational Change explores why we find organizational change difficult and what we can do to keep people focused and performing at their best. It looks at our need for social connection at work, the essential role that leaders and managers play, how best to manage emotions and reduce bias to avoid making flawed decisions, and why we need communication, involvement and storytelling to help us through change. It also sets out a new science-based planning tool, SPACES, to enhance motivation. Drawing on the author's successful masterclasses, Neuroscience for Organizational Change provides practical guidance and examples from big-name organizations such as Lloyds Banking Group, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Orbit Housing Group and BAE Systems. Each chapter includes checklists and questions to help the reader to reflect on what they might take away and apply to the specific context of their own organization.","Emotion Limbic system Subjective experience Motivation Neuroscience"
